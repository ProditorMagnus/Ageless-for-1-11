>Mercs hotfix by IPS
MERCENARIES ERA HOTFIX
General notepad with Mercenaries era adjusments (apart of the blight one which was already worked before). Units that weren't already changed will
just be ignored because of oversight. Isn't diffiuclt noticing that some units are notably stronger than default ones (mostly at lv3) in order to
focus players at using more those factions rather than defaul ones. Some examples are extremely notable like 13-4 club with 6 movement in Law
from Holyhorder. This and many other cases will be revised and fixed. Mostly for standarizations (prices, damage, stats, etc). So let's begin with
the general hotfix at mercenaries era units.

AVIANS
General standarizations, huge changes (Dart line was nerfed in another review)

Archer
Noticing that it's a cheaper version of Drake burner but pierce ranged and neutral aligment. For standarizations... this is going to be nerfed
but lowering its price. Likely 5 MP flying with 7-3 isn't already strong ... apart of 6-2 mele.

Claws 6-2 -> 5-2
Northwind 9-2 -> 8-2
XP 50 -> 48

Health 55 -> 44
Movement 6 -> 5
Claws 9-2 -> 7-2
Northwind 9-3 -> 8-3
XP 100 -> 80

Winged Baron
Health 68 -> 58
Mele 9-3 -> 8-3
Gust 11-4 -> 9-4
Northwind 14-3 -> 11-3
Price 47 -> 50
Coment: likely Leadership isn't enough nice with 6 MP and Flying...

Claws 7-3 -> 6-3
Gust 8-4 -> 7-4
XP 100 -> 80
Coment: it's slow, but not as slow as most 4 MP considering it flies. Reasson why it's not that heavy in stats.

Dreadnought
Absurd damages... but considering its name we will compensate it in other ways.
Gust 13-4 -> 11-4
Northwind 20-2 -> 18-2
Impact resistance -10% -> 0%

Grounded
Not as heavy as other 4 MP units, will take considerations due higher defense and not that bad movement costs.
Mace 11-2 -> 10-2
Cold & Fire resistances 0% -> -5%

CULTISTS
They actually lacks of too much ranged, we will give some modifications to make this faction less handicaps from having too poor ranged. In overall
ranged range adjusments. Also a nice new... I WILL WRITE descriptions for those units! as a cult for Cultist!

Cultist
DESCRIPTION: Cultists are a group of men that usually have secret reunions, no-one is sure about their real intentions, but the true is that they're
commonly seen fighting weird creatures and monstrosities in their side, so cultists are both feared and hated.
--> Spanish: Los cultistas son un grupo de hombres que frecuentemente tienen reuniones secretas. Nadie sabe de sus verdaderas intenciones, pero lo
cierto es que se les ve luchando con criaturas y mounstrosidades de su mismo bando razÃ³n por lo cual los cultistas son tanto odiados como temidos. 

Covert
Considering it has a way stronger mele than Rogues and that he looks a bit boring to sight, we will add him a very weak ranged atack.
NEW ATACK: Darts 5-1 pierce ranged
DESCRIPTION: Coverts are misterous people, there is not that much information about them apart that people consider them as humanity traitors because
fighting in the side of those unknown monsters and weird mutants.
---> Spanish: Los Encubiertos son gente algo misteriosa, no se conoce mucho de estos individuos aparte de que algunos los consideran como traidores
de la humanidad al estar luchando al lado de estos mounstros desconocidos y mutantes extraÃ±os.

Executioner NEW ATACK: Darts 5-3 pierce ranged
DESCRIPTION: They're named Exectutioners just because if you question them why they are doing those genocides they will just ask 'for the common good'
which is strange coming from a genocidal... inquietant... but there is a question...
What does want this people exactly?
And what are their reassons for the genetic manipulation, asesinations and inmoral acts.
---> Spanish: Se les llama verdugos porque sÃ­ le pides una explicaciÃ³n a estos hombres del porquÃ© de sus acciones estos solo dirÃ¡n 'por el bien comÃºn'
algo que parece bastante extraÃ±o viniendo de un genocida... inquietante... pero cabe preguntarse Â¿quÃ© es lo que esta gente quiere exactamente? y 
cuales son sus razones para justificar tantos experimientos genÃ©ticos, mutilizaciones y actos inmorales.


Spy
Needle 8-2 blade mele -> 9-2 pierce mele (it still poisons)
NEW Atack: Darts 5-2 pierce ranged (bleeding)
DESCRIPTION: Spies are the most mysterous of all cultist, he's probably watching the human society disorders... maybe this mantains he to acomplish
the factions goals... who knows if they're mentally right or not ...
---> Spanish: El espÃ­a es el mÃ¡s misterioso de los cultistas, el estÃ¡ observando los desordenes de la sociedad humana.... quizÃ¡s esto le permita
mantener las metas de su facciÃ³n... sabrÃ¡ alguiÃ©n sÃ­ estos sujetos estÃ¡n bien o mal de la cabeza ...

Overt
Health 45 -> 40
NEW ATACK: Throwing daggers 4-2 blade
Description: The diference between overt and covert is that covert are more Introverts and less talkative than overts. They feel more secure for some
reasson.
---> Spanish: La mayor diferencia entre los Encubierto y los Abiertos es que los encubiertos manejan todo con cÃ³digo encubierto y que los Abiertos
hablan con menor remordimiento pÃºblico sobre sus acciones. Se sienten mÃ¡s seguros por alguna razÃ³n.

Cleanner 
Dagger 7-5 -> 6-5
NEW AACK: Throwing daggerrs 6-2 blade
Description: Similar than the case of Executioners, if you question why their actions they refer as themselves as Cleanner... they don't provide a
very developed argument of their actions, making us to think that they probably just like seing the flow in the floor.
---> Spanish: Similar a los verdugos, sÃ­ le preguntas a estos sujetos el porquÃ© de sus acciones estos se referirÃ¡n a sÃ­ mismos como limpiadores...
no dan un argumento muy convincente del porquÃ© de sus acciones, dandole de pensar a muchos que estos solo disfrutan ver la sangre derramarse por el
suelo.

Exile
Like costless skrimisher isn't already too good... forest defense is a serious issue... huge damage for skirmisher standards.
Trudgeon 7-3 -> 6-3
Forest defense 70% -> 60%
Swamp defense 70% -> 50%
Description: Exiled are men that used to be in the human society like any good man, but because of diferences in belief or because of a miss-
understanding those men ended bein exiled. After living for some time in the wild those men found a cultist and after a long talking the cultist
persuaded him to fight for their cause. Letting us to think that a good man can easly join to the cause of cultists.
---> Spanish: Los exiliados eran hombres que antes formaban parte de la socidad como todo buen hombre, sin embargo, debido a la diferencia de sus
creencias o a algÃºn malentendido a estos hombres se les ha exiliado de la sociedad. Acostumbrados a vivir en medios silvestres, un dÃ­a estos hombres
por alguna razÃ³n se encontraron con un cultista que los persuadiÃ³ para unirse a sus causas despues de una larga charla. Dando a entender, que un
buen hombre puede fÃ¡cilmente unirse a las causas de los cultistas.

Banished
Actually a good unit, but for survival purposes we will add him 60% castle defense. But nerfing some miscelanous terrain defenses.
Health 50 -> 48
Castle defense 50% -> 60%
Swamp movement cost 1 -> 2
Swamp defense 70% -> 50%
Fungus defense 70% -> 60%
XP 74 -> 64
Price 25g -> 27g
Description: After some time, Banished are started to be haten like cultists are, doesn't cares to the banished, he's completely used to be rejected
by the society but not to the cultists. He probably became arrogant and more immoral than used to be.
Spanish: Despues de cierto tiempo, los desterrados empiezan a ser odiados como los cultistas, cosa que no le importa. Ãl estÃ¡ completamente 
acostumbrado a ser rechazado por la sociedad pero no por los cultistas. El probablemente se ha vuelto mÃ¡s arrogante y algo mÃ¡s inmoral que antes.

Condemned
Health 74 -> 70
Mace 16-3 -> 15-3
Castle defense 50% -> 60%
Swamp movement cost 1 -> 2
Swamp defense 70% -> 50%
Fungus defense 70% -> 60%
Price 44g -> 46g
Description: It's said that if the society finds this individuals they would have death condemn ... the reasson are variable, but it looks like that
those men were brainwashed, he's irreconosible.
---> Spanish: Se dice que sÃ­ la sociedad pilla a uno de estos individuos tienen condena de muerte ... las razones son variadas, pareciera como sÃ­
estos hubieran pasado por una especie de lavado cerebral, estÃ¡ irreconosible.

Lonewolf
Nerfs on the way, this unit has unnusually good properties.
Health 52 -> 42
Claws 7-4 -> 6-4 (preventing 9-4 skirmisher during night...)
AMLA XP 100 -> 85
Price 32g -> 30g
Description: Some exile prefer more to stay in wild rather than going for cultists goals, cultists have no problems with that and they gift him
wolves claws in one of his two hands. They trust that when he is called for figting for the cult he will proceed.
---> Spanish: Algunos exiliados perfieren estar mÃ¡s en lo salvaje que por ir a las metas de los cultistas. Los cultistas no tienen problema alguno
con eso y le dieron garras de lobo en una de las 2 manos. Ellos confian que cuando se le llame para luchar por el culto este participarÃ¡.

Freak
I've never liked Freaks at all, didn't never liked their stats at all. I will make it more atractive to use.
Fist 9-2 -> 10-2
Fire resistance -20% -> -15%
Cold resistance 0% -> -5%
Mountain defense 50% -> 40%
Village defense 50% -> 40%
Swamp defense 60% -> 40%
Description: Freaks are weird green humanoid creatures with hard skin and that are clumsy. No-one knows their exact origin, but it's sure it's not
human being. It's probably a the result of a wrong experiment that it was left to die.
---> Spanish: Los mounstros son criaturas humanoides extraÃ±as de color verde con una piel dura y que son torpes. Nadie sabe su origen, pero se estÃ¡
seguro que no son humanos. Es probablemente el producto de una experimentaciÃ³n a la cual se le dejÃ³ morir.

Miscreation
Fist 13-2 -> 15-2
Pierce resistance 40% -> 30%
Fire resistance -20% -> -15%
Cold resistance 0% -> -5%
Mountain defense 50% -> 40%
Village defense 50% -> 40%
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Price 22g -> 28g
Description: Miscreation has grown unnaturally fast. Unexpected to live that long... Now it has claws in one of the 2 hands, being not symetrical. 
Looks like it's genetically designed for fighting ... but why it was left to die earlier?
coded for fighting. This give us that cultist have an oddly good knowledge of genetics.
---> Spanish: la Mala creaciÃ³n ha crecido inusualmente rÃ¡pido. No se le esperaba vivir tanto... ahora tiene garras en una de las 2 manos, siendo
asimÃ©trico. Pareciera que fuÃ© geneticamente diseÃ±ado para luchar, lo cual destaca que los cultistas tienen un extraÃ±amente buen conocimiento de la
genÃ©tica.

Mouunstrocity
Fist 15-3 -> 16-3
Blade & Pierce resistance 40% -> 35%
Fire resistance -20% -> -10%
Cold resistance 20% -> 10%
Mountain defense 50% -> 40%
Village defense 50% -> 40%
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Price 47g -> 48g
Description: Mounstrosity is the final result of a creature that fought for its life in an hostile world. Afterall the failed experiment wasn't 
a failure, but wasn't probably what cultists wanted in the begin. Looks like cultists now apreciates this creature. But ... what were trying cultists
to do that ended in such horrible creature? we could say that freaks were the hardest of their experiments and that ended with unwanted results.
---> Spanish: La mounstrosidad es el resultado final de una criatura que ha luchado en un mundo hostil. Despues de todo el experimento fallido no 
fuÃ© un fracaso, pero muy probablemente no era lo que los cultistas estaban buscando. Los cultitas al parecer ahora aprecian a esta criatura. Pero...
cabe preguntarse Â¿que estaban intentando estos que terminÃ³ en esta horrible creatura? podrÃ­amos decir que es el experimento mÃ¡s dificil de ellos y
que probablemente ha terminado con resultados indeseados.

Lookout
Extremely good scout unit, but we will make some reconsiderations
Impact resistance 0% -> -5%
Village defense 60% -> 50%
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Description: Apart that those men are more swift than regular humans, there is not that much diference between regular humans. Apart of having a weight of 15 less kilograms than a regular human in average there is not that much diference apart of regular humans.
---> Spanish: Aparte de que estos hombres son mÃ¡s lÃ­geros que los humanos regulares, no hay mucha diferencia. Aparte de tener un peso de 15 kilos
menos que un humano comÃºn, no hay mucha mÃ¡s diferencia.

Sentry
Considering some rebalancing.
Health 48 -> 45
Impact resistance 0% -> -5%
Fire Arrow 10-2 -> 8-2
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Village defense (unchanged, mostly for the name)
Price 25g -> 30g
Description: Sentry similar to lookout, are swift. Also for some reasson those men are given the purporse to watch and warn if their camps are
being atacked. Apart of their innusual swiftness, those men look like that need less sleep to acomplish their function.
---> Spanish: parecido a los atentos, son ligeros. Aunque por alguna razÃ³n a estos hombres se les ha dado la tarea de vigilar y de avisar sÃ­ sus 
campamentos estÃ¡n siendo atacados. Aparte de su ligereza inusual, al parecer estos hombres necesitan dormir menos para cumplir su funciÃ³n.

Beacon
Health 65 -> 60
Torch damage 14-3 -> 13-3
Fire arrow 14-2 -> 12-2
Description: Beacon has now a weight more similar to regular humans, but afterall, he's still as fast. They're completely sane mentally giving us
to know that he got used to live with that lot of monsters, misscreations and cultist doing inmoral experiments. Thes men shine for a solid emotional
and mental health unlike most of their companions. It's said that some beacon leaves the cult for days to live in the society and then coming back
to the cult, but probably with no kind of intention or betray singals.
---> Los faro tienen ahora un peso mÃ¡s similar al de un humano regular, pero ante todo, el sigue siendo asÃ­ de rÃ¡pido. Son completamente sanos 
mentalmente a diferencia de sus compaÃ±eros incluso al vivir entre tantos mounstros, mal formaciones y cultistas haciendo experimentos inmorales. 
Estos hombres destacan por una solida estabilidad y salud mental. Se dice que estos algunas veces dejan al culto para vivir en la sociedad y luego
volviendo al culto, pero lo mÃ¡s probable es que sin ningÃºn tipo de intenciÃ³n o signos de traiciÃ³n.

Recruit
Spar 3-2 -> 4-2 ranged
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Fungus defense 60% -> 50%
Description: Cultists oftenly recruit mercenaries that fight for anyone's cause for some coins. Those men have no idea in what their live will turn...
---> Spanish: Los cultistas frecuentemente reclutan mercenarios que luchan para cualquiera por algunas monedas, pero estos no tienen idea de que 
les espera en sus vidas...

Rebel
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Fungus defense 60% -> 50%
Price 28g -> 27g
Description: Rebels and Subverters after fighting some time for the cultist they're still figting for the cult, but unlike recruits they opposite 
society and do not fight just for coins. They still have no real idea the meanings of the cult, but they don't seem to be brainwashed, just uninformed.
---> Los rebeldes despues de pelear un tiempo con los cultistas siguen haciendolo, pero a diferencia de los reclutas estos se oponen a la sociedad y
no pelean solo por monedas. Estos aÃºn no tienen idea de las implicaciones del culto, pero no parecen ser vÃ­ctimas de un lavado cerebral, solo estÃ¡n
desinformados.

Subverter
Spear 8-4 -> 7-4 ranged
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Fungus defense 60% -> 50%
Description: Rebels and Subverters after fighting some time for the cultist they're still figting for the cult, but unlike recruits they opposite 
society and do not fight just for coins. They still have no real idea the meanings of the cult, but they don't seem to be brainwashed, just uninformed.
---> Los rebeldes despues de pelear un tiempo con los cultistas siguen haciendolo, pero a diferencia de los reclutas estos se oponen a la sociedad y
no pelean solo por monedas. Estos aÃºn no tienen idea de las implicaciones del culto, pero no parecen ser vÃ­ctimas de un lavado cerebral, solo estÃ¡n
desinformados.

Transformation
Some readjustments will be needed.
Fire resistance -20% -> -10%
Swamp defense 70% -> 60%
Fungus defense 70% -> 60%
Price 25g -> 27g
Description: Transformation used to be human ... it's not known what kind of process ocurried to them... but looks like cult is capable to corrupt
the genetic data of already born living. The question is ... what kind of technique they use for those genetic manipulations... creepy... also, it
does still think like an human; also which would be reassons of why those men allowed themselves being the product of such experiments.
---> Spanish: La transformaciÃ³n solÃ­a ser humano... no se sabe que clase de proceso ha ocurrido en ellos... pero al parecer el culto es capaz de
corromper el cÃ³digo genÃ©tico de un ser ya nacido. La pregunta es ... Â¿quÃ© clase de tÃ©cnica utilizan para sus manipulaciones genÃ©ticas? aterrador...
sin embargo, esta cosa aÃºn piensa como un humano, pero cuales habrÃ¡n sido las razones para que estos hombres se permitieran ser produco de estos 
experimentos genÃ©ticos.

Mutant
Bite 25-1 -> 23-1 (RPG potential)
Fire resistance -20% -> -10%
Cold resistance 10% -> 0%
Swamp defense 70% -> 60%
Fungus defense 70% -> 60%
XP 124 -> 110
Price 45g -> 47g
Description: Mutant is starting to lose its Human features even at its personality as human. Looks like that it's not just genetic corruption it's
now conscience corruption too. It is just becoming into killing machines ... also, it's said that recruits that acess for the genetics modifications
were men that wanted to forgive their past and that were better informed about the cult itself.
---> Spanish: El mutante estÃ¡ empezando a perder sus razgos humanos y su personalidad como humano. Al parecer la corrupciÃ³n no es solo genÃ©tica sino
tambiÃ©n de conciencia. Se estÃ¡ volviendo una mÃ¡quina de matar ... aunque, se dice que los reclutas que se permiten estas modificaciones genÃ©ticas eran
hombres que querian olvidar su pasado y que estaban mejor informados sobre el culto en sÃ­.

Inhuman
Pierce resistane 40% -> 30%
Fire resistance -20% -> -10%
Swamp defense (unchanged)
Fungus defense (unchanged)
Price 55g -> 70g
Description: Inhuman has no longer human characteristics. It has an incredible feast for killing (not just humans). Still it's hard to make those
things to talk, also it can still can mantain a conversation, also its vocal chords will difficult it to talk, apart of decrease inteligence than
a regular human, still, if it were persuaded it could tell us a lot about of the cult ... sadly, it's too loyal to them.
---> El Inhumano a no tiene rasgos humanos. Tiene ina increible sadiedd por matar (no solo a humanos). Aunque es dÃ­ficil hacer que estas cosas hablen
pueden hablar, aunque sus cuerdas vocales le dificultan hablar, aparte de su inteligencia inferior a la de un humano regular, aÃºn asÃ­ sÃ­ fuese 
persuadida podrÃ­a hablarnos un montÃ³n sobre el culto ... lÃ¡stimosamente es demasiado leal hacia ellos.

Survivor
Due the buff of some ranged units in the faction, survivor has been nerfed a bit.
Health 50 -> 47
Fire resistance 0% -> -5% - /rejected
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Fungus defense 60% -> 50%
Description: The survivor is a real accomplishment to the cultist's genetics. If we look, all cultists are men or asexual, but never female. They 
consider the male gender as the superior gender and for that reasson they do not consider the female gender because of their genetics knowledge.
DescripciÃ³n: El superviviente es un logro de la manipulaciÃ³n de la genÃ©tica de los cultistas. SÃ­ nos fijamos bien, todos los cultitas y sus mutantes
o son del gÃ©nero masculino o son asexuales, pero nunca son del gÃ©nero femenino. Consideran el gÃ©nero masculino como el superior y razÃ³n por la cual
consideran necesario del gÃ©nero femenino dada a sus avanzados conocimientos de la genÃ©tica.

Outlaster
Health 74 -> 65
Fist 10-2 -> 11-2
Fire resistance 0% -> -5% - /rejected
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Fungus defense 60% -> 50%
Price 24g -> 30g
Description: Outlaster is a proof man about any extreme climatic situation and capable to live alone in the wild. It's unknown why cultist wanted a
too resistant and long lived creation unlike most of theirs. Meaning that the cult have long time goals...
---> Spanish: El duradero es un hombre a prueba de cualquier situaciÃ³n climÃ¡tica extrema y es capaz de vivir solo en lo salvaje. No se sabe porque
los cultistas querian una creaciÃ³n tan longeva muy diferente de la mayorÃ­a de ls creaciones de ellos. Queriendo decir que el culto tiene una meta
de largo plazo...

Remnant
Health 92 -> 85
Inner Strength 32-1 -> 27-1
Fire resistance 0% -> -5% - /rejected
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Fungus defense 60% -> 50%
Price 46g -> 53g
Description: After decades of long long living, looks like he's stronger than ever. In his actual age any human would feel weak, ancient or sick,
but Remnant is more healthy than ever. Some remnant tried to have sons with regular women to try to build a genetically superior humanity, but for
their surprise they're not fertile. At this point they start understanding that the cult goals aren't completely good for human race and at a point
they just start fighting for their ownselves.
---> Spanish: Despues de varias decadas de larga vida, parece que Ã©l es mÃ¡s fuerte que nunca. En su edad actual cualquier humano se sentirÃ­a dÃ©bil, 
anciano o dÃ©bil, pero el restante estÃ¡ mÃ¡s sano que nunca. Algunos restantes trataton de tener hijos con mujeres regulares para construir una 
humanidad superior, pero para sus sorpresas ellos no son fÃ©rtiles. En este punto ellos comprendieron que las metas de el culto no son completamente
buenas para la raza humana y que en cierto punto de sus vidas ellos empiezan a luchar por ellos mismos.

Primordial
Inner Strength 45-1 -> 39-1
Fire resistance is now 0% (like originally)
Description: Primordial is the sucess of eugenecy. Primordial proved to be immortal at being stronger the older he is. His cells instead of deteriorate
over the time, they improve during the pass of the time. It's not known if this process has a limit, but the few silver mages that studied this kind
of men said he has an expected life of at least 900 years but no more than 2000 years because the process consume certain energy from the envoroiment
thing that growns gradually over the time, in a point, the primordial would die because of inanition because there wouldn't be enough food (or better 
said, food with the energy requirements) to mantain this process in the current world, even at the conclution of an hypothetical case in which even
 if he spend his whole life eating he would still die due inanition. If wasn't due this fact he would be completely immortal againist the pass of 
the time... fact that of course, cultist will never know.
---> Spanish: El primordial es el Ã©xito de la eugenecia. Ha demostrado ser inmortal al ser mÃ¡s fuerte mientras mÃ¡s envejece. Sus celulas envez de
deteriorarse con el paso del tiempo, estas mejoran a medida que el tiempo pasa. No se sabe sÃ­ ese proceso tiene un lÃ­mite, pero los pocos magos de
plata que han estudiado esta clase de especimenes determinaron que podrÃ­a tener un tiempo de vida de al menos de 900 aÃ±os pero no mÃ¡s de 2000 aÃ±os ya
que el proceso consume cierta cantidad de energÃ­a del ambiente, la cual aumenta gradualmente con el paso del tiempo, en un punto en el cual el morirÃ­a
de inaniciÃ³n ya que no habrÃ­a suficiente comida (o comida con suficiente energÃ­a) en el medio para mantener el proceso. Incluso,
concluyendo en un hipotetico caso que aÃºn comiendo todo el dÃ­a morirÃ­a de hambre... Si no fuera por este hecho, el serÃ­a completamente inmortal al 
paso del tiempo... hecho del cual los cultistas nunca sabrÃ¡n.

Swimmer and Waiter lore will be done for 1.13 version. I have no good idea for those.


EQUESTRIANS
This is a faction of only mounted units, also, it has many overpowered units. On here we will give a consideration to the faction at all being
mounted units (which commonly gives pierce weakness).

FACTION ISSUE: Mostly because all their units are +6 MP or more, most of their leader options moves more than 6 tiles per turn, meaning in considerable
balance issues. This needs considerations like slow trait.

faction status also sometimes will be considered some status adjusments for standarization.

Contestant
Frozen defense 60% -> 50%
Sand Movement cost 3 -> 2
Coastal Rift defense 40% -> 30%

Stonethrower
Actually this unit performs a way better than Dwarvish thunderguard. Impact is harder to counter than pierce is, reasson why boulder got nerfed.

32-1 -> 30-1
Frozen defense 60% -> 50%
Sand Movement cost 3 -> 2
Coastal Rift defense 40% -> 30%

Coastal Rift defense 40% -> 30%
Price 17g -> 19g

Valkyrie Princess

Price 49g -> 52g


EMPERORS GUARD
There are some balance irregularties that we will fix. We're talking about nerfs but not nerf in mass. I'm out of time and I'm sure some other units
deserve more the fair nerf.

Martial Artist
Looks like +10% terrain defense and counter are underrated and being the only impact atacker, let's increase its price
Price 14g -> 16g

Musha
Leap kick nerf considering it has higher terrain defense (takes less damage if missing)
Leap kick 16-1 -> 15-1
Price 28g -> 30g

Blackbelt
Leap kick 22-1 -> 20-1
Price 46g -> 50g

The only problem of this unit is the innusually good ranged atack that the mele line has. We will left everything else unchanged.
Kunai 4-3 -> 3-3

Ninja Warrior
Kunai 5-4 -> 4-4
Price 27g -> 32g

Shinobi

Similar to drake burner, but quicker and with fire breath -1 damage. The unit is fine, we will just increase a little the xp to lv2.
XP 48 -> 52

Tatsu
Considering the lv3 has 8 movement and really nice damage, raising xp to mantain stats unchanged.
XP 76 -> 80

Ryong
Price 48g -> 54g

Kyu
Readjusting some stats.
Wakizashi 7-3 -> 6-3
Price 25g -> 27g

Elite Kyu
Wakizashi 10-3 -> 9-3
Yumi 12-4 -> 11-4
Price 45g -> 51g


HOLY ORDER
Recently noticed that some units have balance irregularities... let's fix most of that.

Crusader
Price 25g -> 26g

Cleric
At stats it's being fine, the only issue it's odd low xp.
XP 22 -> 30

Bishop
This level up is actually out of place, we will give him decent stats for a better figthing role and a small boost to team utility.
Holywater 12-1 -> 7-2 (with this we make him more useful in normal games and nerf RPG or Oricia potential)
Arcane resistance 30% -> 40%
NEW SPECIAL: Cures (will now be capable to heal poison, but no more)
XP 75 -> 93 (Plans for Lv3)
Price 35g -> 29g

Archbishop
Considering that the healing option was much more popular than the Archbishop, decided to bring something really SPECIAL for this one.

NEW SPECIAL: Cures
NEW AURA: Illuminates
Price 48g -> 52g

Priest
Actually kinda overpowered, let's nerf
Health 48 -> 42
Cross 11-2 -> 9-2

Pope
First of all, pope was the support with both healing and illuminates? was making Archbishop being not considered. Removing Illuminates. And some
stats nerfs. By the removal of Illuminates, having him as an healer being chaotic faction will be less akward and will not over-reward that much if
playing an lawful faction.
Touch 10-3 -> 8-3
Blessed Word 6-5 -> 5-5
Arcane resistance 80% -> 60%
NO LONGER HAS ILLUMINATES
Price 48g -> 50g

Overpriced unit.
Price 34g -> 27g

Torturer
Underpriced unit. Lv3 terror is something to consider in price.
Price 44g -> 52g

Judgementor
Nerfing it's ranged damage first of all because of being too ABUSABLE in RPG or in Oricia gameplay. And second because it's not being fair.
Judgement 22-1 -> 14-1
Coment: Elvish hero is 6-3 ... with pierce which is easier to counter.

Supreme Judge
Judgement 34-1 -> 22-1
Price 42g -> 44g

All lightwisp and lightwisp advancements were revised previously. Hard nerds on the way for lightwisps except a strong buff for Twilight.

Spear 6-1 -> 5-1

Listener
Spear 13-2 -> 12-2
Price 30g -> 32g

Eyes of Fate
Price 47g -> 51g

Would tolerate that 11-3 if it wasn't impact damage which is harder to counter than both pierce or blade. Just standarizations.
Trudgeon 11-3 -> 10-3
Impact resistance 0% -> 10%

Law
Standarization process. We will make him a way better for RPG but not that powerhouse damage.
Trudgeon 13-4 -> 11-4

Impact resistance 0% -> 15%

Swallow Water defense 30% -> 10%
Swamp movement cost 3 -> 4
Swamp defense 30% -> 10%
Coastal Rift defense 40% -> 20%
 - Coment: we left 60% castle defense and 40% flat defense which are the most important in survivals... but decided to do this to make other choices
more atractive than just 'more damage options'.

Student
Lightbeam 8-3 -> 7-3
Fireball 11-2 -> 10-2
Coment: wtf? it was being a mage + dark adept that had better damage than both of each... mmmm...?

Mage
Lightbeam 11-3 -> 10-3

Ballast
Actually a bit too nice ... nerfs...
Lightbeam 12-4 -> 10-4
Fireball 20-2 -> 18-2
Cold/Fire resistance 20% -> 15%
Price 48g -> 52g

Health 42 -> 38
Movement 6 -> 5
Lightbeam 9-4 -> 8-4
XP 100 -> 80
Price 50g -> 44g
