Implementing balance changes to EFM proposed by IPS, while taking some freedom. I agree with Velensk's review with EFM that 
many of changes are harmless but thematically unfit, while it's true that the EFM factions can use some buffs. In my personal
opinion it's better to just buff some numbers, but IPS proposed many weird stuffs to add, so I left out many changes that I 
can't agree with.
