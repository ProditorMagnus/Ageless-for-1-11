Seems that 1.12.1 decided to start enforcing "id: faction ID - must be unique to your era. No gameplay effect" of [ multiplayer_side].
better grouping would be "not defaultlike"
change archaic and EoC multiplayer side ids, fix factions ids, arc mp sides placeholder ids, randoms list
sort eras and factions alphabetically
