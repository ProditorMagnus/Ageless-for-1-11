Unified EoMa water ambush and EotF shallow submerge abilities. (but still having different SPECIAL_NOTES)
Unified ME sand stalk and EotF beach home abilities. Now called sand ambush.
Unified EoMa swamp ambush, ME sloughblend & EFM lurker abilities. Now called swamp ambush.
Unified EoMa cave ambush and EE cavestalk. Now called cave ambush.
Also improved terrain matching.

Unified EoMa hit_and_run abilitie with the one from ME. Me gave 4 MP back, now it's just 3 MP. Because of that, the one ME unit who uses it got +5 HP. But when I looked at it, it looked quite strong. Lvl2 with 55 HP now, 8-3 ranged, ambush, swamp ambush and hitandrun.
