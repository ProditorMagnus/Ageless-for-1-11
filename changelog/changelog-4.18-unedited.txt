Unified EoMa water ambush and EotF shallow submerge abilities. (but still having different SPECIAL_NOTES)
Unified ME sand stalk and EotF beach home abilities. Now called sand ambush.
Unified EoMa swamp ambush, ME sloughblend & EFM lurker abilities. Now called swamp prowl.
Unified EoMa cave ambush and EE cavestalk. Now called cave ambush.
Moved snow cover to general abilities, mountain ambush remains within the EoMa abilities.
Improved terrain matching for many abilities.
Unified EoMa hit_and_run abilitie with the one from ME. Me gave 4 MP back, now it's just 3 MP. Because of that, the one ME unit who uses it got +5 HP. But when I looked at it, it looked quite strong. Lvl2 with 55 HP now, 8-3 ranged, ambush, swamp ambush and hitandrun.
--Yokai
Observations:
a) Mandragora has too low base health compared to Spriggans. Still, too low xp to full reheal.
- Mandragora Health from 30 to 36.
- Mandragora XP from 50 to 60 (Greater Spriggans are 100 XP to reheal)
- Due Mandragora's impopularity, NEW ATACK: Scream 5-2 impact ranged (lv1 Spriggans are 6-2 ranged)
- Mandragora price from 15g to 16g

b) Nixies looks too strong, considering they're recruitable. Still, we want to make her as a very special lv1.
- Mele damage rework 5-3 -> 3-4 cold mele
- Ranged damage rework 5-4 -> 4-4 impact ranged
- NEW ATACK: Water spray 3-5 cold ranged
- Cold resistance 20% -> 30%
Coment: at this point they're fair as regular lv1 but with cool extra considerations for survival maps or RPG gameplay.

c) Faeries: Not too popular too, changing their arcane resistance from -10% to +10%.

d) Febyron line observations:
- I did love the results of actual Feyborn line, increased XP for Kitsune to Lv3 made me to consider to own a Tengu which was worth it. Increased XP makes Tengu more considerable.
- Ninetailed fox ranged damage rework: Spectral Shard 7-7 -> 8-6
Coment: With the 10% extra cold/fire resistance at all feyborns (except tengu) they don't need to be that powerhouse in oricia (only 1 damage loss in regular gameplay). Still, pierce atack can be used at certain circunstances to take less damage from retaliation.

e) Kodama: It's actually a really strong unit in the side of hidden OP. 
- Draining Touch 16-2 -> 14-2

f) Banshee/Onryo: Not tested this time, but they look kinda underpowered considering default Wraiths and Shadows are 25 and 24 health respectively but with 50% physical resistance. 
- Health from 28 to 32 for both of them.
- Banshee: NEW ATACK: Touch 3-2 arcane mele (no specials)
- Banshee's Symphony of Ruin 8-4 -> 7-4
Coment: with this I hope to increase Banshee's popularity a bit, most people goes for Phantom or in few Cases by Onryo.
