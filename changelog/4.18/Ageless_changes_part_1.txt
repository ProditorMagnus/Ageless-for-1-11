We'll on this update focus at Infernai, Fanatics balance. On these factions there are units that are never recruited and others that are recruited a 
way too much ... equilibrating both of the most popular and most impopular lines in  the factions we are going to modificate.

FACTION CHANGE - FANATICS: -10% sand defense to all non flying-floating Fanatics; let's stop giving unfair adventage to players in sand terrain maps.
Also, unlike desert elves, Fanatics have a way better resistances than those elves which justificate their 50% sand defense; also they still mantain
that valuable 60% hills defense.
Warrior
Price from 26g -> 27g

Zealblade
Price from 45g -> 48g

Martyr
Price from 40g -> 35g (80% hit chance, just 1/8 discount)

Terrorist
Actually overpriced.
Price 34g -> 30g

Fearmonger
Underpriced terror lol ... Lv3 terror -> Lv2 terror
Price 45g -> 54g

Mindless
Looks a bit weak and underused, just a small bonus at damage.
Torch 11-2 -> 12-2

Follower
NEW ATACK: Fire spark 2-1 fire ranged (just to avise that this line gets ranged now!)

Devoted
Kinda impopular unit actually, let's make him a way more atractive... compesating the folloing nerfs at master Genies.
NEW ATACK: Fire Sparks 2-4 fire ranged
Fire resistance 20% -> 30%
Price 22g -> 25g

Fanatics
NEW ATACK: Fire sparks 2-5 fire ranged
Fire resistance 20% -> 35%
Price 45g -> 46g

Genie
Actually a unit with too many properties, at first we will nerf lightning in order to players consider more the Followers; as well resistances.
Lightning damage from 8-2 to 7-2
Fire/Cold resistances 50% -> 40%

Master Genie
Lightning 11-3 -> 13-2 fire magical
Snowball 7-4 -> 6-4
Fire/Cold resistances 50% -> 40%
(if sprite is given, NEW EVOLUTION: Grand Master Genie)
XP for lv3: 115
Price: 50g -> 48g
Coment: too defensive healer that had already too much damage... balance considerations...
Price from 50g to 47g (considering nerfs)

Grand Master Genie (if submited a day)
Scimitar 10-1 blade mele
Lightning 15-2 fire ranged magical
Snowball 9-4 cold ranged magical
HP: 46
MP: 5
Price: 68g
Resistances: the same than lv2, but -10% to arcane instead -20%.

Gossiper
Faction lacks of impact atackers, and genies are fine doing cold damage. Apart this nerfs the damage of this unit againist certain units. It's support.
Rant is now impact instead of cold!

Misinformant
Price 40g -> 36g
Rant is now impact instead of cold!

Propagand
Price 43g -> 54g
Rant is now impact instead of cold!

Sandskulker
Bow 12-4 -> 11-4
Ambusher
XP 81 -> 70

Overpriced... no skirmisher...
NEW ATACK: Sling 3-2 impact ranged
Price 34g -> 25g

Bandit -> Sand Bandit
NEW ATACK: Sling 5-3 impact ranged
Price: 45g -> 43g

Prowler
NEW ATACK: Throwing knives 3-4 blade ranged

--rejected start
Noticing that this faction doesn't has impact atackers at all... apart of the impact mele from Gossiper. So for this function a new unit is needed.
This is something that is needed because of the Charred Zombies from the blight which are highly resistant to all fire, cold, blade and pierce.

NEW UNIT: Sand Footpad
Let's use the sprite at: https://www.wesnoth.org/units/1.12/Ageless_Era/en_US/AE_stf_eventide_Desperado.html
Club 6-2 impact mele
Sling 5-2 impact ranged
HP: 30
MP: 6
XP: 43
Price: 16g
Advances to: Sand Outlaw
Resistances and defenses: the same than Streetrat.

NEW UNIT: Sand Outlaw
For the sprite it can be used a recolor of Knalgan's outlaws, intended to be very similar in stats.
Mace 10-2 impact mele
Sling 5-3 impact ranged
HP: 45
MP: 6
XP: 68
Price: 27g
Advances to: Sand Fugitive
Resistances and defenses the same than streetrat.

NEW UNIT: Sand Fugitive
For sprite a recolor of Knalgan's Fugitives.
Mace 13-2 impact mele
Sling 5-5 impact ranged 
HP: 65
MP: 6
Price: 48g
Resistances and defenses: the same that streetrat.
Specials: Concealment.
--rejected end

Minotaurs
One of the least popular factions due the very expensive units and the 50% castle def (not high resistances at all). Their low defense mixed with
their weaknesses outputs factional strength that is divine health ... for sure you can't regen if you're already dead lol... we will do something
to make them more atractive in overall. 

FACTION CHANGE - MINOTAURS: All units are given arcane resistance from -30% to -20%. Minotaurs doesn't have any resistance againist any specific
atack type, so we decrease their common weaknesses. Second of all, regen+3 is weaker the higher level you're in, so I would sugest that all
level 3 minotaurs gain Divine health en (regen 6 version of the faction). Doing this, we award more those players that pick warlock over Mystic.
Gnolls are not afected from this general modification.

Boar Knight
This unit needs some fixing... like the absurd amount xp to lv3 and lower stats than Loyalist's knights. The lv1 is more balanced so no modifications.
Spear 8-3 -> 9-3
Impact resistance 20% -> 30%
XP: 120 -> 110 
Price: 42 -> 37

Cataphract
In honor to its name we will give it some extra resistances and decent spear damage
Spear 12-3 -> 13-3
Impact resistance 20% -> 30%
Pierce resistance -20% -> -10%

Cutthoat
I've seen similar units with similar stats for the price of 15g or 18g ... but this has few extra things from those...
Health 40 -> 42
Price 22g -> 21g

Slayer
Blade resistance -10% -> 0%
Proce 38g -> 35g

Executioner
Price 65g -> 58g
Coment: Now might be a really solid lv3 unit with regen+6 and 10% less arcane resistance.

Gnoll
Standarization of castle defense to 60%

Keeneye
Castle defense 50% -> 60%
Price 30g -> 27g

Sharpeye
Price 42g -> 48g

Rouser
We will make it a powerhouse in terms of damage, but mantaining its weaknesses, just some little bonus health and the arcane res buff.
Health 50 -> 52

Overlord
We gift it +1 mele damage at lv2, we take out -1 ranged damage at lv3
Crossbow 9-4 -> 8-4
Price 69g -> 60g

Savage
Blade resistance -10% -> 0%
Price 39g -> 35g

Warlock
Price 50g -> 45g


Era of Strife - Eltireans
Some units will get reworked in order to standarize balance. Some of those are overpriced or underpowered or overpowered. We will have a look at them.

Bishop of Eltire
Mediocre at lv3 but too cheap in XP, let's rework her lv3 to make her stronger at lv3.
Lightbeam damage from 8-2 to 9-2
Arcane resistance from 20% to 40%
XP: 50 -> 80
Price from 40g to 38g due no mele to defend herself from mele or berserks.

Archbishop of Eltire
NEW ATACK: Mace 12-1 impact mele (no specials)
Light beam damage from 10-2 to 13-2
Lightbolt damage from 8-4 to 9-4
Arcane resistance from 20% to 60%
Price from 60g to 54g

Lightbringer
She's actually overpowered. Illuminates in that faction is a very useful aura in the faction (it's like leadership but much better). We will
give her a support focus more than a weirdly efficent hybrid fighter...
Health from 48 to 44
Movement from 6 to 5
Lightsword damage from 6-5 to 5-4
Lightbeam damage from 8-2 to 7-2
Arcane resistance from 20% to 30%
Coment: lv1 damages with more or less lv2 damage with illuminates and slow on ranged. Not that bad at all. Lv2 illuminates is rare and worth
for 40G even if owning lv1 stats, in the right army it's really cost efficent; because does work in ANY unit in the faction.

Dawnbringer
Health from 60 to 55
Movement from 6 to 5
Lightsword from 8-5 to 8-4 (it's actually the same than a paladin apart of really good ranged...)
Lightbeam damage from 10-2 to 11-2
Arcane resistance from 20% to 40%
Cold resistance from 0% to 10%
XP to 80.
Price from 65g to 54g

Elementalist
Price from 21g to 22g
Coment: it's not just +3 mele damage, 5-4 cold magical weapon and +1 movement version of mage, that needs considerations.

Pyromancer
Excesively good mele from standard mage...
Staff from 8-3 to 5-3
Fire resistance from 0% to 10%
Price from 45g to 42g
XP from 80 to 90 (some extra plans for his lv3)
Coment: Being 6 Movement is a good reasson to cost more than red mages. Also he passed from a standarization process.

Infernal Master
Firestaff is renamed to Staff. Staff damage from 13-3 (WTF?!) to 7-3.
NEW ATACK: Staff 6-3 fire mele
Fire resistance from 0% to 30%
Price from 60g to 62g (it's superior than Archmage in many angles)

Hydromancer
Hydroblast damage from 17-2 to 11-3 (decreases RPG potential, increases realism)
Cold resistance from 0% to 10%
Swallow water/swammp defense from 20% to 30%
Coastal rift defense from 30% to 40%
Price from 48g to 42g

Hydromonger
Staff from 8-3 to 8-2
Hydroblast damage from 23-2 to 16-3 (RPG potential... nerf)
Cold resistance from 0% to 20%
Swallow water/swammp defense from 20% to 40%
Coastal rift defense from 30% to 40%
Deep water defense from 0% to 20%
Price from 68g to 64g
Coment: It's really worth it's price considering the extra physical atack and the water movement costs extras and extra MP.

Whirpool Lord
Staff from 8-4 to 8-3
Hydroblast from 30-2 to 21-3
Cold resistance from 0% to 20% (yup, the same than lv3, water terrain extras are worth it)
Swallow water/swammp defense from 20% to 50%
Swallow water movement cost from 3 to 2.
Coastal rift defense from 30% to 50%
Deep water defense from 0% to 40%
Price from 100g to 77g
Coment: now fear the new Whirpool lord if he spawns in Oricia's last wave! >:D ... well, now a more notisable lv4 unit.

Crusher
Impact resistance from 0% to 20%
Price from 32g to 27g

Destroyer
Impact resistance from 0% to 30%
Coment: a little of balancing... he was a way inferior than default's royal guard at owning 1 less Movement and less health (and -40% resistances)

Calmblade
Cold resistance from 0% to 20%
Frozen movement cost from 3 to 2
Frozen defense from 20% to 30%
Coment: Fun easter egg about frozen terrain performance that few players will notice by accident.
Price from 32g to 28g

Frostwalker
Cold resistance from 0% to 20%
Frozen movement cost from 3 to 1
Frozen defense from 20% to 40%
Coment: Frozen versality at the cost of bonus cold resistance. Potentiating this unit's unique personality (considering it's a lot older than 
Frost humans...)

Impact resistance from 30% to 15%
Price from 42g to 50g

Lady o War
Cold resistance from 0% to 10% (similar to fencers)
Coment: I don't find any way to deal its small cost ineficiency, just adding that cold resistance... like once done in default era with fencers...

Temptress
Really hard to balance ... 7 MP, 35 HP ... are interesting stats, but health looks too low (but has 7 MP...) maybe resistances...
Cold resistance from 0% to 15%
XP from 90 to 75
Price from 38g to 29g

Siren
Cold resistance from 0% to 20%
Price from 54g to 50g

Considering the no lv3 status, we will give them a little few extra resistances
Impact/Pierce resistance from 0% to 10%

Arcane Archer
 - No lv3 unit, will consider stronger her a bit for a little best performance. Apart of owning less hp than Bowmistress ... it has less pierce dmg.
 - Compared to other arcane atackers this unit looks boring... let's fit this
Bow damage from 8-3 to 7-4 (just to diferenciate more to the other lv2)
-> Arcane arrow has now has marksman!
Arcane resistance from 20% to 50%

Eventide Herbalist
Price fro 18g to 17g
