Observations:
a) Mandragora has too low base health compared to Spriggans. Still, too low xp to full reheal.
- Mandragora Health from 30 to 36.
- Mandragora XP from 50 to 60 (Greater Spriggans are 100 XP to reheal)
- Due Mandragora's impopularity, NEW ATACK: Scream 5-2 impact ranged (lv1 Spriggans are 6-2 ranged)
- Mandragora price from 15g to 16g

b) Nixies looks too strong, considering they're recruitable. Still, we want to make her as a very special lv1.
- Mele damage rework 5-3 -> 3-4 cold mele
- Ranged damage rework 5-4 -> 4-4 impact ranged
- NEW ATACK: Water spray 3-5 cold ranged
- Cold resistance 20% -> 30%
Coment: at this point they're fair as regular lv1 but with cool extra considerations for survival maps or RPG gameplay.

c) Faeries: Not too popular too, changing their arcane resistance from -10% to +10%.

d) Febyron line observations:
- I did love the results of actual Feyborn line, increased XP for Kitsune to Lv3 made me to consider to own a Tengu which was worth it. Increased XP makes Tengu more considerable.
- Ninetailed fox ranged damage rework: Spectral Shard 7-7 -> 8-6
Coment: With the 10% extra cold/fire resistance at all feyborns (except tengu) they don't need to be that powerhouse in oricia (only 1 damage loss in regular gameplay). Still, pierce atack can be used at certain circunstances to take less damage from retaliation.

e) Kodama: It's actually a really strong unit in the side of hidden OP. 
- Draining Touch 16-2 -> 14-2

f) Banshee/Onryo: Not tested this time, but they look kinda underpowered considering default Wraiths and Shadows are 25 and 24 health respectively but with 50% physical resistance. 
- Health from 28 to 32 for both of them.
- Banshee: NEW ATACK: Touch 3-2 arcane mele (no specials)
- Banshee's Symphony of Ruin 8-4 -> 7-4
Coment: with this I hope to increase Banshee's popularity a bit, most people goes for Phantom or in few Cases by Onryo.
