AE Frozen Human
In overall we’re doing a lot of standarization to the faction. It has too many weird stats balancing which IPS is not right with.
All frozen humans might be 50% frozen defense instead of 60% in order to prevent unfair adventage in certain types of maps.
-> Same terrain defense nefs for Nordhiris faction too, and ME highlanders


Frozen Golem 
We’re reworking this unit in order to make it a more scout role one. Cold attack type is already common in this faction.

Coment: lv3 terror... reprices this unit a lot ...

Monofu price from 26 to 32

Shuriken Thrower
Sickle damage from 4-2 to 5-2
Sickle is now PIERCE damage (already too much blade dmg in the faction)

Rebalancing this unit. Doesn't feel like a ranged unit with that lv2 ranged damage, but mele is oddly annoying to deal againist.
