ARCHAIC - Meganaire
Obviously this faction has many irregularities. Mostly problems with pricements and units needlessly too good while others too ignorable. With this
it's intended that all units feel more fair when recruited instead of feeling like doing an huge discount buying units such like Drones or feeling
how your money was being wasted after seing bad results from Scout Robots or Earth elementals.

EE - Outlaws
Sugesting the adition of a healer line for them. Would make help them to be more popular between players.
Having first a look at: https://units.wesnoth.org/1.12/The_Golden_Age/en_US/Cunning%20Woman.html

Cunning Woman (chaotic)
HP: 23
MP: 5
Dagger 4-2 blade mele
Dispell 4-3 arcane ranged +magical
- Heals+4
Resistances:
-20% to blade, -10% to piere/impact, 20% to arcane
Terrain defenses: (kind of swift foot, but 50% flat defense, 60% hills/forest defense/castle/village defense).
Advances to: Outlaw Witch
XP: 40
Price: 15g
Description: Sometimes even in marginality places there are people with talents to magic. Usually men living in corrupt surroundings have no time to even
notice if they had potential to magics, so some of those outlaw men could have talents for magic but sadly they will never have time to wonder if they
had or not talent for magics. Unlike in the case of men, women doesn't have that physical strength so many of them while chilhood experimentated a lot
of diferent things... also for the surprice of some of these women they have talent for magic arts. Usually outlaws thief a lot of things, some of those
magical books that almost nobody uses at all, also few cunning women autodidacts themselves in order to learn how to heal their wounded outlaws 
companions. Once they gain enough experience their foes names them Outlaw Witches and when they start being feared by the enemies who face them they
are named as Archwithches.

Outlaw Witch (chaotic)
HP: 34
MP: 6
Dagger 5-2 blade mele
Dispell 6-3 arcane ranged +magical
Ensnare 6-2 impact ranged +slows
- Heals+8, cures
Resistances:
-20% to blade, -10% to piere/impact, 20% to arcane, 10% to fire/cold
Terrain defenses: (kind of swift foot, but 50% flat defense, 60% hills/forest defense/castle/village defense).
XP: 70
Advances to: Outlaw Archwitch
Price: 32
Description (the same than cunning woman).

Outlaw ArchWitch
Health: 46
MP: 6
Dagger 6-2 blade mele +poison
Dispell 7-4 arcane ranged +magical
Poisoned Thorns 7-3 pierce ranged +poison +marskman
Ensnare 6-3 impact ranged +slows
- Heals+8, cures
Resistances:
-20% to blade, -10% to piere/impact, 20% to arcane, 10% to fire/cold
XP: 150
Advancement: AMLA
Price: 55
Archwitches have a wide knowledge of the nature which she can use againist her enemies. She can now cast poisoned thorns which are hard to direct mostly
in retaliations. Archwitches are respected by any magician considering that all her training and knowledge was adquired autodidactly and no-one teached
her. Usually witches and Archwitches are few, and rarely they interact with other in their lives before being recruited by the same outlaw army in 
where they usually meet eachother. 

--> The intention of EE is being pair in balance with Default era, not being completely superior unlike most eras wants to. So, for the stats of the 
cunning woman I used old school balance like it's seen in Saurian Augurs and in Elvish Druids.

MERCS - ENCHANTERS
For this faction in this ageless update there will be just adjustments of those runes like 2-10 atacks or similar, decreasing the amount of strikes
but leaving intact the total damage. Apart of minor adjustments. Also some other modifications like renaming and some reworks.

Rune Fire Specialist
Due to his impopularity (mostly because has no lv3), he's going to resive a buff.
Fire resistance from 0% to 20%
Price from 40g to 43g

Arcane rune transcriber
Arcane resistance from 20% to 30%
Light rune damage from 2-10 to 3-7
Price from 40g to 44g

Arcane rune splicer
Chisel (mele) damage from 7-1 to 9-1 (it's not recomended that it be the same than lv2)
Light rune damage from 3-10 to 5-7
Holyfire rune damage from 14-3 to 12-3
Arcane resistance from 20% to 30%
Fire resistance from 0% to 10%
Price from 50g to 57g

Rune purist
Chisel (mele) damage from 10-1 to 11-1
Light rune rework from 1-13 to 2-10 but has still concentrated special.
-----> Calculus:
---> Old Rune purist damage
-> Average sucessful strikes: 13 x 0.7 (70% hit) = 9.1 strikes in average.
-> Average damage (if hits 9 strikes) = 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 45
---> NEW Rune purist damage
-> 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9 = 44 (but needs 8 sucesful strikes)
-> Average new strikes: 7 / 0.7 = 11,4 total strikes are needed to be equivalent
---> Due nerf We end with 2-10 instead of 2-12 or 2-11 !!
---> New average damage would be: 2+3+4+5+6+7+8+0+0+0 = 35 (same than Mage of Light without illuminates)
-> In compensation of his damage loss, increased arcane resistances, so he can now counter easier arcane atackers.
[Coment]: I needed to do inverse calculus too, to determinate how many strikes in total Rune purists did need in order to leave almost unchanged his
+1 damage in all strikes by even counting his +concentrated special which increases damage per sucessful strike by +1.
--> Arcane resistance from 20% to 40%
Price from 50g to 55g
[Coment 2]: I got a plan how to change rune purists offensive in order to be less abusable at RPG/Survivals (like orocia) but leaving him almost 
unchanged in normal games or more normie suvivals without upgarades. With this, he won't be that massively beneficiated from gaining +damage from the 
shrine or buying damage at the RPG map. They're equivalent but will never be the same at all.
--> Opinion About concentrated: looking at how it works, it's not a good special at all, I mean, needs too many strikes and high accuracy in order 
to trigger oftenly because the damage snowballs stacks per sucessful strike. 70% magical is the minimun accuracy needed to make this ability work fine.

Rune Mage
Chisel damage from 9-2 to 7-2
Light rune damage from 3-10 to 4-8 (wouldn't harm that much at all)
Ice rune damage from 5-6 to 6-5 and +enchanted (60% hit) instead of +magical
Fire/Cold resistances from 0% to 10%
Price from 50g to 62g
Coment: Ice rune atack is much better than light rune or even fire rune atacks, needs accuracy nerf to try to equilibrate it with the other atacks if
gained upgarades at a scenario in order to force a damage loss when using ice rune atack instead of the other atacks.

Rune Master
Health from 75 to 68
Chisel damage from 10-3 to 8-3
Ice rune damage from 8-6 to 10-5 enchanced (60% hit) instead of +magical
Fire/Cold resistances from 0% to 15%
Price from 60g to 77g

wow this unit's tree...

Elemental Rune Interpreter
--> changing his name to something like 'Rune Elementalist' ... really much shorter, thanks.
Ice rune damage from 3-6 to 4-5 and is +enchanted (60% hit) instead of +magical
Coment: the accuracy nerf is intended to be more intense the strongest the unit becomes, because accuracy is the only aspect that can never be improved
in all those survivadl/rpg games.

Cold Rune Splicer
--> Renaming him to 'Rune Splicer', due he mantains fireballs and that is not precisely cold at all XDDD
Water rune damage from 12-3 to 10-3 because it slows and is physical (impact) damage, which is still useful againist magic resistant units.
Ice rune damage from 4-6 to 5-5 but is still +magical (ice rune specialization, no needs to nerf accuracy)
Fire/Cold resistane from 0% to 10%
Price from 50g to 55g

Ice rune Improver
Removal of fireballs, he's the most specialized in ice runes.
Ice rune damage from 9-5 to 8-5
Freeze rune damage from 5-8 to 5-7
Cold resistance from 0% to 30%
--> Frozen movement cost from 3 to 2
--> Froezn defense from 30% to 40%
Price from 50g to 57g
Coment: his ice runes needed to be nerfed, he cannot deal as much damage as a regular mage but aditionally with +slows special.
Coment 2: I'm completely sure that I have never seen one of those previosly, apart their damage decrease isn't significant compared to the +30% cold 
resistance. Also he gained some extras at frozen terrain because of the loss of his fireballs.

Clearbow
Price from 30 to 32

Crystalbow
Arcane resistance from 20% to 30%
Price from 45 to 50
Coment: Due its not that high popularity, desided to not nerf arcane atack damage for now. Apart that's a tons of XP for only +8 HP seems ok.

Blazier
Bow (pierce) damage from 9-3 to 7-4 (still marskman, it's mostly to diferenciate more from clearbow's 8-3)
Bow (fire) damage from 22-1 to 14-2 (considering that clearbow is magical and this atack is just marskman, its much worser than clearbow's atack).
Fire resistance from 0% to 10%

Incinerator
Short Sword damage fro 4-4 to 5-4 (shouldn't be the same than lv2's mele)
Fire resistance from 0% to 20%
Price from 45 to 52

Price from 46 to 53

Floating/Magic/Shifter Swords
Movement from 8 to 7
Cold resistance from 50% to 40%

Magic Sword
Price from 35 to 33

Possesed sword
Movement from 10 to 9
Arcane resistance from -40% to -30%
Price from 34 to 32

Enchanted Sword
Movement from 8 to 7
Arcane resistance from -20% to -10%
Cold resistance from 50% to 40%

Excalibur
Movement from 8 to 7
Light beam damage from 5-4 to 5-3
Arcane resistance from 20% to 10%
Cold resistance from 50% to 40%
Price from 60 to 70
Coment: Becoming -20% -> +20% arcane resistance is an HUGE diference, that's 120% damage to 80% which is 1/3 less. To decrease the impact of the fact,
as personal desition I desided to increase Lv3 swords arcane resistance while decreasing Lv4 Excalibur arcane resistance.

Cursed Swords
Some enchanters specializes at crafting deadly swords that can be sharpen easier than common steels and at being more light than usual with the cons 
that this strange metal needs to consume a part of the living essence of the user in order to not break down. Once the user dies poetically we can
say the same about the cursed sword itself at becoming into a regular sword which is heavier than before when it was cursed.

Cursedhand
Cursedhand after some fighting experience and after understanding better how cursed swords does work, they made a small modification to it, so now if
they consider necesary, their swords can now drain the living essensce of the rival as well but it does still consume the user meanwhile. With those 
modifications, the user himself loses some arcane and fire tolerance. 

Devilhand
Cursed Sword (25-2) has no longer +cursed (I've seen 2 strikes units with 25-2 easly)
Price from 49 to 50
After many battles with the sword devilhand have perfectionated the use of the cursed sword. Apparently if the user does not direct contact with the 
blade of the cursed sword and instead only grabs the handle of the sword the sword will not consume his user while striking. Also, grabbing the sword
in that way decreases the amount of strikes that can be done, still if he uses the cursed sword as usually it will drain the living essence of both the
user and the opponent.

Sacrificer
Sacrificers are not that much diferent than Cursed Sword users, with just the diference that they are more deadly and that they will hurt themselves
even more.
Coment: it has good chances of losing againist units like loyalist's swordsman cause of taking really much damage from cursed special.

Sell Soul 
health from 65 to 68
Price from 49 to 50
Once sellsoul starts a fight only one thing is garanteed, is that will be a tragic battle for life or death with a tension that is not seen anywhere
else. Get ready this gonna hurt for sure.

Powermad
Health from 72 to 76

Apocalyptic
Blade/Pierce/Impact resistances from 0% to 10%

Just balance manitenance for this faction, apart that some people says this faction is too weak compared to many others.

Purifier
Price from 40 to 42

Arsonist
Price from 30 to 32

Guard
I'm sure I've seen units that by costing less are stronger than Guards are.
Sword damage from 10-2 to 11-2
Impact/Pierce resistance from 20% to 30%
Price from 20 to 19
Coment: Doesn't has steadfast... but has solid resistances.

Roadclearer
Damage from 17-3 to 15-3 (but has +triple strike)
Impact/Pierce resistances from 20% to 35%
Price from 40 to 55
Coment: Adapting both Advancements of Guards in order to be equivalent in toughtness to +steadfast tanks. Also, I do not want to make guards be
+steadfast because it's too mainstream.

Stonewall
Considering that Stonewall has lower terrain defenses (50% castle defense for example) unlike gatekeeper, they should have more resistances than their
gatekeeper counterparts.
Health from 60 to 56
Movement from 3 to 4
Sword damage from 14-2 to 9-3

Blade resistance from 30% to 35%

Coment: it's like I gift him +quick trait (somehow, but for +33% movenent the diference needs to be more notisable in HP)

Spire
Health from 78 to 70
Movement from 3 to 4
Sword damage from 20-2 to 11-4
Arcane resistance from 20% to 30%
Blade resistance from 40% to 45%
Fire resistance from -20% to -15%
Mountains/Water/Swamp movement cost from 3 to 4
Price from 40 to 57
Coment: The intention is to make tank units that can work without steadfast.

Longboat
I dislike the distribution of its stats... Important changes will occur to this unit.
--> Swamp defense from 30% to 40%
-> Flat movement cost from 5 to 3 (isn't as realistic, but in gameplay balance, belive me, it's annoying the previous way)
-> Castle movement cost from 3 to 2
-> Forest movement cost from 99 to 5 (meaning this unit is now capable to move 1 forest then 1 water tile if the opportunity exists).
-> All ground non flat terrain defenses are 0% now.
Resistances:
50% to arcane
40% to Pierce
30% to cold
20% to impact
10% to blade
-30% to fire
Health: 55 (considering it has no traits)
Greek fire is still 5-4 (arson is mostly a nerf againist aquatic units)
Balista damage from 9-2 to 11-2
XP: 65 (yup that's a lot of XP)
Price: 22g
Coment: The intention of this is to make this unit really strong and cost efficent if it finds to mantain itself in water tiles, once out of water,
        Shouldn't be that tanky at all. Apart it will be more similar to the new ships that soon will be implemented to Ageless from Rashy Era.
Coment 2: It's fun how arson lowers damage againist units at water tiles but at being stronger againist other ships.

Trireme
---> Swallow Water defense from 40% to 50%
--> Deep water defense from 50% to 60%
