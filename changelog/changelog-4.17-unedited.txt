Wargs: Wolf Cup -1 cost
Therian Falcon, Gryfalcon, Peregrine Falcon: -1 movement
Shifting animation for Therian cats, starting with level 2
There is one for the lvl 1 too, but disabled. To enable, see units/EoM_units/therians/b1_Cat.cfg
The same goes for the Therian Falcon.
Celestial use their own names (from the campaign "A song of Fire")
Vampires are now undrainable (except the Blood Hulk)
minor fixes and refactorings
>start Balance note 1 by IPS
Balance observations note 1

- forgot to coment that bacterium (lv1) must be -25% to both cold and fire.
- Quenoth Revager mele 11-4 to 10-4, in the notepad I said the oposite. -- so 12-4 to 10-4

Oracle - Arbiter line
The line is actualy needlessly too good, let's decrease ranged damage.
Arbiter ranged damage from 10-1 to 8-1
Theurgist ranged damage from 15-1 to 12-1
Judmentor ranged damage from 22-1 to 18-1

Oracles - Mage/Magus
Their mage is like loyalist one but with teleport. It can't be recruited but can be gained from leveling lv0 mages. Only planned nerf is their movement.
Movement from 6 to 5.

Yokai - Weaver Maiden and level ups
Noticed that spiders weaknesses are too high (-50% at all levels right now) Let's improve their resistances per leveling up.
Lv1 resistances: -25% arcane resistance  and -15% to fire.
Lv2 resistances: -20% arcane resistance and -10% to fire.

Yokai - Feyborn Witch
1.- Feyborn Witches aren't  that atractive actually on the faction (no lv3, no mele). Something that can could work is changing her ranged atack type.
2.- Noticing that Yokai lacks a lot at pierce, withces can become pierce instead of blade. So 8-3 Spectral Shard Blade -> Pierce.
3.- Maybe some bonus cold/fire resistance could help this unit perform better as no lv3 healer/mage: +10% resistance to fire and cold.
With this, Yokais wouldn't depend of units with Swarm to deal pierce damage on survival maps.

Sylvans - Wose Shaman
Noticing their overperforming a lot, making other wose unwanted. Let's take a rid of this.
Ranged 9-2. So on this way, it's still good but doesn't dazzle people from the other wose choice.
Screenshot: http://puu.sh/r6rVr/c78f2526cf.jpg

Sylvans - Fire Faerie
For ghost like resistances, she has a way too much health... (see default ghosts). Would decrease their health severly.
Health from 40 to 32 (same than lv2)

Sylvans - Warrior Spirits
Mixing ghost like resistances with terror and drains is something very underrated... This needs balance considerations that aren't taken.
Terror is a skill that the higher level a unit is, the more efective is, so at this point lv2 and lv3 are going to be taken in acount to be nerfed.
- Ancestor Lv2 terror aura (-30% damage from lv1 and -15% from lv2)
a) Health from 25 to 21, with drains that shouldn't be a problem; forces players to be less carefree at the use of them.
b) Because lv3 terror is something REALLY anoying to fight againist, would raise their xp from 72 (70% modifier) to 100 (70% xp modifier)
- Forefather obviusly overpowered mostly because of terror aura without considerations.
a) Health from 35 to 27; to force players to don't carefree at the usage of them.
b) Since terror can be used to help alied units as well, I see no problem at making its ranged to 4-3.

Sylvans - Dusk Faerie
later, pending.

Infernai - Evil Essence
Ghost like unit with slows + drains on mele and absurd amount of health. Health 32 -> 26, Ranged 11-1 -> 6-2 to decrease RPG potential.
 
Trivalist - Scalper
Could scalper line have 60% castle defense?
Executioner: Mele impact 38-1 -> 35-1 to nerf a bit RPG potential.

Oracle - Blindman
Considering he has only 20% to hit offensively and -20% terrain defenses and 4 movement... reprice 16g -> 13g. Not a very loved unit at all.
He is archer's practice target!!
 - - Master: Reprice 34g -> 32g.
 
Enchanters - Titan
Thinking about trying their village/castle defense to just 30%. But increasing Arcane resistance to 30%. Greatsword to 22-1 because rpg potential.

MERCS - Lv1 Archers 
Since Mercenaries era is a very old and unmantained era, in which was built when loyalist bowman was 6-2 blade mele but 15g, most Lv1 ranged units
needs a revision for a proper standarization.
** Holy Order - Witch Hunter: Archer with poison dagger, so let's reprice to 17g tier.
 - - Demons Slayer: Reprice to 36g, 2 diferent atack types at ranged and poison on mele.
 - - Purifier: Reprice from 46g to 55g because of high quality archer.
** Infernai - Gog: Unnsually strong mele but a way too weak to cold. Mele 6-2 -> 5-2 (so won't be 9-2 at night if strong).
 - - Magog: Mele to 8-2 (same as Longbowman) & cold res -40% -> -35%. Reprice from 29g to 32g.
 - - Incubus: cold res -40% -> -30%. Reprice from 42g to 50g.
** Mercenaries - Neglet Mage: Nothing to consider at all, except on some of his level ups.
 - - Warrior Mage: Mace 12-2 to 11-2.
 - - Battle Mage: Mace 18-2 -> 16-2 (dread) & Sword 9-4 -> 8-4 (Magical) & Ranged 13-3 to 11-3 (magical). Overperforming unit actually.
** Mercenaries - Hunter: Mele damage 5-3 -> 4-3. It's like a Poacher (14g unit) but better.
** Oracles - Darkmage: This line is actually somehow absued. Let's decrease ranged damages 12-2 to 11-2.
 - - Necromantic: Ranged damage from 18-2 to 16-2.
 - - Quietus: Ranged damage from 18-3 to 16-3.
 ** Oracles - Evileye: mele damage 10-2 -> 8-2
 ** Oracles - Conjurer: Extremely clever (fire+ranged ranged mix, and more!) reprice 39g -> 46g.
** Refugess - Focul: Ranged damage 11-2 -> 10-2
 - - Arsonist: Excesively overpowered unit. 24 mele damage and 36 ranged damage. Let's nerf for sure!
a) Mele damage rework 4-6 -> 5-4 (To make it less abusable in RPG games)
b) Ranged damage 12-3 -> 11-3.
** Slavers - Harlot: reprice 10g -> 16g.
** Slavers - Gatherer: reprice 32g -> 34g.
** Tribalists - Rowboat: Would sugest to add them (and lv2's) 50% swallow water and swamp defense, also decreasing lv1 ranged damage 6-3 -> 5-3.
 - - Canoe: Reprice 27g -> 29g (considering defenses buff)
** Tribalists - Archer: reprice 28g -> 32g.
 - - Native: Reprice 46g -> 49g.
** Tribalist - Hunter: Poison is less significant on lv2. Reprice 33g -> 31g.
 - - Slayer: Reprice 45g -> 47g (same damage than archers, but with poison as well)
** High Landers - Forester mele damage from 8-2 to 7-2. For for just lv1 50% forest defense only.

MERCS - The Blight REBALANCE.
It's obvious that some of their units have crazy resistances in a point that isn't fun dealing againist them if you've built wrongly againist certain
the blight units. Some units will be nerfed inmediatly considering their probable anoyanse in the fields.

 ** Microbe: 
 - Impact and Pierce resistance to just 70%.
 - Blade/arcane resistance from 20% to 15%.
 - Fire/ and Cold weaknesses to -25%.
 - Health from 10 to 12
 ** Bacterium: 
 - health from 20 to 24. 
 - blade/arcane resistance to 20% in Lv1
 - increases pierce/impact resistance to 75%.
 Coment: RPG/Survivality potential were too high for just 5g tier unit. Still a viable pick for Creepwars.
 
 ** Seeded: Massively broken unit in game. First of all, player can mantain them alive in order to block tiles for mele retaliations without risk
 of losing them; dealing probably more damage than sacrificing them as soon you can. Let's nerf the following:
 - Giving range 'suicide' or 'kamikaze' similary seen in gobling kamikaze.
 - Lowering their impact/pierce resistance to just 60%.
 - Lowering blade resistance to 0%
 - Increasing health to 18 hp.
 
 ** Charred Corpse: so far one of most resistant units in the game. Let's do the following:
 - Cold/Fire resistance to 55% (instead of 70%)
 - Arcane resistance from 50% to 45%
 - xp from 45 to 40 (28 xp at 70%)
 ** Mutilated corpse:
 - Cold/Fire resistance to 60%.
 - Blade resistance to 40%.
 - Pierce resistance to 30%
 - Arcane resistance from -50% to -40%.
 - xp from 82 to 69 (48.3 xp at 70%)
 ** Dreadbones:
 - Cold/Fire resistances to 65%.
 - Blade resistance to 55% (from 70% is an hard nerf)
 - Pierce resistance to 45% (from 50%, not that much this time)
 - Arcane resistance from -50% to -35%.
 Coments: Charred zombies and level ups were nerfed, but they needed a way too much xp...
 
 ** Blobs: let's do a redistribution of their resistances to a more fun alternative:
 - Pierce/Imapct res to 65% (from 80%);
 - Blade Resistance to 15%.
 - Cold Resistance to -30%.
 - Health to 16.
 Coments: Originaly Blob's relative health to pierce/impact was 50hp, now is 45,7hp and now is less suceptible to instant die againist other atacks.

 ** Acids:
 - Impact/Pierce resistance to 75%.
 - Cold resistance to -40%.

 ** Amoeba: Apart of their absurd amount relative health againist some atack types (being 170! for lv1), there are some things that can be improved:
 - Blade resistance from 20% to 10%. Now it might spawn blobs with more health.
 - Impact/Blade resistance to only 60% (from 80%); now might take x2 times more impact/pierce damage (relative health is now 102 from 170)
 - Cold resistance might be now -30%.
 - Amoeba damage is low compared to other options. Absorb 14-1 considering it has lower resistances now. 
 - NEW ATACK: Dissolve 8-2 fire drains & swarm but not absorb
 - NEW ATACK: Spread 4-1 impact ranged (swarm)
 COMENT: Yup, it's planed that if the unit has more than maximun health Dissolve can become 8-3 or even higher :D 

 ** Slime: let's make Slime the cold resistant line on Blobs and more:
 - Impact/Pierce resistance to 70%.
 - Cold resistance to 10% (from -50% uh really a lot!)
 - Fire resistance from -20% to -40% considering massive boost at cold resist.
 - Blade resistance to 30%.
 - Absorb from 13-2 mele drain to 9-2.
 - Dissolve damage from 15-1 to 13-1.

 ** Ooze: Some modifications to the unit:
 - Impact/Cold resistance to 70%.
 - Cold resistance to 15%.
 - Fire Resistance to -35%
 - Blade resistance to 30%
 - Absorb from 16-2 to 14-2
 - Dissolve Damage from 20-1 to 17-1

 ** Host: Only ranged unit in the faction, let's increase their base ranged damage but decreasing their absurd potential to deal brutal damage.
 - Spores damage reworked from 1-12 too 2-7. Now enemies extremely resistant to pierce will take less damage.
 - NEW WEAPON: Spores 1-3 pierce mele (swarm, denfense only)
 - Blade resistance from -20% to 0% -worse terrain defenses than usual-
 - Health from 30 to 34 -considering it moves only 4 tiles-
 ** Spore Hive: Let's rework ranged and add a really weak mele atack.
 - Ranged damage reworked from 2-15 to 3-10.
 - NEW WEAPON: Spores 1-5 mele pierce (swarm, defense only)
 - Blade resistance from -20% to +10% -worse terrain defenses than usual-
 Coment: Worst mele weapon in whole Ageless, but better than nothing. Makes this unit more viable in maps like Colosseum and more fun at Orocia.
 
 ** Infected Hound: Charge damage from 10-2 to 7-2, has 50% flat defense less to gamble than on common chargers. Apart has no charge mele weapon.
 - Undead Hound: Charge damage from 16-2 to 11-2, same reassons than on Infected Hound.
 
 ** Fetid: Physical resistances too high...
 - Blade resistance to 20%
 - Pierce resistance to 30%
 - Fire resistance to -30%
 coments: factions like Knalga and others without fire/arcane suffer againist this unit.
 ** Dismembered: resistances distribution that I don't like... let's readjust:
 - Blade resistance to only 30%
 - pierce resistance to just 50%
 - Imact resistance to 20% -instead of 10%- (on lv1 has 40%)
 - Fire resistance from -40% to -30%
 ** Rancid:
 - Pierce resistance to 40%
 - Fire resistance to -30%
 ** Putrid:
 - Impact resistance to 40% (before was 30%, lower than in lv2)
 - Fire resistance to -30%
 coments: on thiss case I buffed the lv3, which had lower resistances than lv2 ... but reworked lv2 resistances. Now everything suits alright.
 
 
 ** DARK CURRENTSS WILL BE REVIEWED IN A FUTURE REVISION, need to get more used to this line.
 ** PARASYTE LINES LOOKS FINE IN BALANCE.
 

BEEM - Anakes - Devil/Fiend
Their terrain defense is actaully really bad, can't have more than 40% terrain defense. Sugestion: +10% to all terrain defense.
 - Fiend: fix that -10% pierce resistance gained at lv3.

BEEM - Anakes - Dark Prophet
Too low ranged damage. 10-3 is almost lv2 damage, but for sure no lv3 damage. Would sugest a damage of 13-3 or 10-4.
 
Mercenaries - Mustang
14-3 mele impact atack on lv2 unit with 10 movement. No! that's lv3 damage!!!. Let's nerf to 11-3 then.

Avians - Dart
Flying charger in which all his line is overperforming and obviously overpowered. Let's nerf only mele damages.
 ** Dart Charge damage from 10-2 charge to 8-2 charge.
 ** Armor pierce damage from 25-1 charge to 22-1 charge.
 ** Daredevil considering skirmisher, charge damage from 10-3 to 8-3
 ** Divebomber considering marskman charge damage from 13-2 too 11-2
 ** Rocket considering marskman charge damage fro 18-2 to 15-2

BEEM - WoodWarriors - All Rat riders
- First of all, looks a way too out of place that a scout with Torch when he levels up is forced to lose that fire mele atack and forced that its
atacks become blade and pierce. This could be a problem in pvp when deleaing againist players using factions like undead.
* Consindering this, would sugest to add a lv2 line with torch and unmounted. Maybe 36 hp, 8-3 fire mele and 5-2 fire ranged.
- Second topic, all rat riders are underpowered at having terrible terrain defenses. Would sugest to increase all non flat terrain def by +10%.
* Frog riders are doing much better than rat riders.
If considering to increase terrain defense, consider to nerf a bit their ranged damages. Maybe by -1 or -2 depending the case.


Mercenaries - Holy order - Lightwisp
Actually the Lv1 recruitable unit with most resistances in the game. With a total of +290% overall resistances. Apart it can hide during daytime
it's a unit with really abusable stats in survival games & RPG ones. The Following nerfs will be done:
 ** Lightwisp: 
 - Ranged damage from 6-3 to 5-3, it's scout, not an archer.
 - Blade/Pierce/Impact resistances to 40%
 - Fire resistance to 50%
 - Arcane resistance to 75% (5% more)
Coment: now is cost ineficent except for dayfade and being arcane on ranged.
 ** Holy Spirit: It's actually doing MUCH better than Twilight, so Holyspirit will be nerfed and Twilight Strongered.
 - Cleanse mele to from 15-1 to 6-2 arcane, now is less abusable in Orocia and on RPG.
 - Lightbeam damage to 7-4
 - Blade/Pierce/Impact resistances to 40%
 - Fire resistance to 50%
 - Arcane resistance to 80% (10% more)
 ** Arcane Wisp: Following nerfs:
 - Cleananse mele from 15-2 to 8-3
 - Lightbeam to 9-5
 - Blade/Pierce/Impact resistances to 40%
 - Fire resistance to 50%
 - Arcane resistance to 85% (15% more)
 ** Twlight: Actually is underpowered compared to Holy Spirit. Let's consider some love for Twilights:
 - New aligment: Neutral
 - NEW WEAPON: Light touch 4-4 arcane mele
 - Lightbeam to 8-3 arcane
 - Blade/Pierce/Impact resistances to 40%
 - Fire/Cold resistance to 30% (+30% at both!)
 - Arcane resistance to 60% (from 0%)
 - Health from 22 to 24
Coments: Now Lightwisp are +245% bonus resistances (+5% per level in Holy spirit advancement) and Twilight is 250% but can hide in 4/6 times
of the day.


Mercenaries - Fanatics - Martyr
Mele range on suicide atack. This means he can use his suicide mele as retaliation and not dying! needs fix!

Archaic - Despair - Statues



DESPAIR GENERAL REVISION
I've seen that some units needs nerf and that many others lv2+ are underpriced. Let's fix prices mostly and let's do the required nerfs.

Despair - Statues
Looking at their resistances, it's obvious that they need fix, apart they have no defense handicaps... let's nerf!
 ** Statue/Stonesoldier/Stonewarrior: resistances rebalance:
 - Blade resistance to 35% (from 60%)
 - Pierce resistance to 45% (from 60%)
 - Impact resistance to 15% (from 30%)
 - Fire resistance to 0% (from 10%)
 - Lower all terrain non castle defenses by -10% their actual values.
 - Would lower moments costs in water tiles to 3 for swallow water/swamp and 4 at deep water. As well 3 MP for mountains.
Coments: -65% total resistances which -55% are physical in nerfs and lowering their resistances and nerfing movility/defense, they're actually
overpowered tanks for sure.

Despair - Widow
Actaully really cost efficent mages. Would sugest to reprice to 17g because and modify HP to 28 because of superior defenses/movility than usual units.
 ** Midnight Beauty: damage nerfss:
 - Mele from 6-4 to 4-4
 - Ranged from 12-3 to 11-3
 - Price from 28g to 32g
 ** Widow in white: Some nerfs too:
 - Health from 41 to 37.
 - Mele from 7-2 to 5-2
 - Price from 27g to 34g
 ** Banshee
 - Mele from 10-2 to 8-2
 - Price from 40g to 50g
 
 ** Despair Dullohan
 - Ranged damage from 9-3 to 8-3 considering movement.
 - Price from 30g to 35g
 * Black Mastercloack
 - Price from 35g to 44g
 ** Black horseman
 - Price from 30g to 33g
 ** Black Slayer
 - Price from 40g to 48g
 
 ** Black Shadow
 - Price from 24g to 30g 
 
 ** Despair Soldier
 - Price from 30g to 28g; overpriced line, curious.
 ** Officer
 - Price from 44g to 54g
 ** Lord Knight
 - Price to 46g (idk, but is more fair than only 39g)
 
 
QUENOTH ELVES REVISION
Many Quenoth Elves are actually overpowered, let's nerf some of those inmediatly:

 ** Quenoth Hunter: among most cost efficent fighters, they got 6 MP! for 15g they're too good... let's nerf their ranged:
 - Bolas reworked from 4-2 to 4-1 because of slow at ranged.
 ** Quenoth Warrior:
 - Mele to 7-4 (from 8-4)
 - Ranged to 5-2 (from 7-2)
Coment: Now players will have to consider aboout using slow to make them worth. But still at 60% def in forest and 50% at sand is still a nice unit.
 ** Quenoth Revager
 - Mele to 11-4 (from 10-4) -- ignored then
 - Ranged to 6-3 (from 8-3)
 
 ** Quenoth Lurker
 - Mele from 4-5 to 3-5 ... Hey, it's a way better than orcish assasins.
 ** Quenoth Seeker
 - Ranged damage to 4-3 (from 5-3)
 ** Quenoth Wayfarer
 - Ranged damage from 10-3 to 8-3.
 ** Quenoth Stalker
 - Mele from 7-3 to 6-3, because of backstab.
 - Ranged reworked from 4-3 to 5-2
 - Price from 30g to 34g
 ** Quenoth Assasin
 - Mele from 9-3 too 8-3 because of backstab.
 - Ranged from 8-3 to 7-3
 
 ** Quenoth Rider
 - Price froom 28g to 32g
 ** Quenoth Sand Dasher
 - Price from 43g to 45g
 
 ** Quenoth Marksman
 - Price from 60g to 40g ... SERIOUSLY OVERPRICED.
 ** Quenoth Sharpshooter
 - Price from 90g to 55g ... SERIOUSLY OVERPRICED.
 
 ** Moon Enchantress: Actually too much damage for a unit with a support aura. Let's nerf
 - Ranged to 7-3 (from 9-3)
 - Price from 34g to 36g
 
 
Mercenaries - Tribalists - Kangaroos
 - Wallaby: sugesting to 50% their castle defense to make them viable in Orocia and some other survivals (same for lv2 and lv3)
Aren't Kanguros hot climated animals? would change their -20% fire resistance to +20% fire resistance considering this, apart of not a very used
unit after all, people doesn't like their stats for Orocia aparently.
 ** Boxer: for people who dares to lv3 it:
 - Mele rework to 9-4 marskman (from 10-4 but no special)
 - Add first strike to 18-2.
 - 15% impact resistance. Used of being hit by fists/kicks of other boxers!
Coment: leveling to boxer needs a lot of xp, let's reward more to players that decided to lv3 for Boxers. 

Mercenaries - Tribalist - Indogenous
Let's half their bonus physical resistances because he has more resistances than Royal Guard alike of better stats than Elvish Hero.
 - Impact resistance to 10% (from 20%)
 - Pierce resistance to 15% (from 30%)
 - Ranged damage to 7-3 (from 8-3)

MERCENARIES ERA HOTFIX
General notepad with Mercenaries era adjusments (apart of the blight one which was already worked before). Units that weren't already changed will
just be ignored because of oversight. Isn't diffiuclt noticing that some units are notably stronger than default ones (mostly at lv3) in order to
focus players at using more those factions rather than defaul ones. Some examples are extremely notable like 13-4 club with 6 movement in Law
from Holyhorder. This and many other cases will be revised and fixed. Mostly for standarizations (prices, damage, stats, etc). So let's begin with
the general hotfix at mercenaries era units.

AVIANS
General standarizations, huge changes (Dart line was nerfed in another review)

Archer
Noticing that it's a cheaper version of Drake burner but pierce ranged and neutral aligment. For standarizations... this is going to be nerfed
but lowering its price. Likely 5 MP flying with 7-3 isn't already strong ... apart of 6-2 mele.
Health 32 -> 33
Claws 6-2 -> 5-2
Bow 7-3 -> 6-3
XP 46 -> 44
Impact resistance -20% -> -15%
Castle defense 50% -> 60%
Swamp defense 50% -> 40%
Price 17 -> 16
Coment: -15% impact resistance balances its movement costs.

Bombardier
Health 56 -> 50
Claws 9-2 -> 7-2
XP 90 -> 75
Impact resistance -20% -> -15%
Castle defense 50% -> 60%

Blowflurry
Health 70 -> 63
Claws 9-3 -> 8-3
Bow 10-5 -> 9-5
Impact resistance -20% -> -10%
Castle defense 50% -> 60%
Swamp defense 50% -> 40%
Price 47 -> 46

Hawkeye
Health 50 -> 45
Claws 6-3 -> 5-3
Impact resistance -20% -> -15%
Castle defense 50% -> 60%
Swamp defense 50% -> 40%
XP 90 -> 75

Eagleeye
Health 62 -> 57
Claws 8-3 -> 6-4
Impact resistance -20% -> -10%
Castle defense 50% -> 60%
Swamp defense 50% -> 40%

Broadwing
Too high health for the damage output it has... a way too notable... considering some adjustments.
Health 38 -> 36
Claws 6-2 -> 5-2
Northwind 9-2 -> 8-2
XP 50 -> 48

Skylord
This is the kind of stuff that made me to consider this whole doc of changes... also the unit which caused this reaction to me wasn't this one.
Health 55 -> 44
Movement 6 -> 5
Claws 9-2 -> 7-2
Northwind 9-3 -> 8-3
XP 100 -> 80
Coment: It's still a bit stronger than I would want to, but too many nerfs... but being honest, 7-4 marksman + 6 MP + Flyin + Leadership wasn't fair.

Winged Baron
Health 68 -> 58
Mele 9-3 -> 8-3
Gust 11-4 -> 9-4
Northwind 14-3 -> 11-3
Price 47 -> 50
Coment: likely Leadership isn't enough nice with 6 MP and Flying...

Skyterror
Considering the 4 Movement handicap, it will end being a bulky ranged fighter. But not in an exagerated way at how is it actually...
Health 60 -> 55
Claws 7-3 -> 6-3
Gust 8-4 -> 7-4
XP 100 -> 80
Coment: it's slow, but not as slow as most 4 MP considering it flies. Reasson why it's not that heavy in stats.

Dreadnought
Absurd damages... but considering its name we will compensate it in other ways.
Gust 13-4 -> 11-4
Northwind 20-2 -> 18-2
Impact resistance -10% -> 0%

Grounded
Not as heavy as other 4 MP units, will take considerations due higher defense and not that bad movement costs.
Mace 11-2 -> 10-2
Cold & Fire resistances 0% -> -5%
Mountain movement cost 3 -> 4
Mountain defense 60% -> 50%

Floater
Needs nerfs, defenitively.
Movement 6 -> 5
Mace 15-2 -> 14-2
Spear 9-3 -> 8-3
Claws 10-3 -> 9-3
Cold & Fire resistances 0% -> -5%
Mountain defense 60% -> 50%
Swamp defense 50% -> 40%
Coastal Rift 50% -> 40%
Unwalkable movement cost 1 -> 2
Unwalkable defense 40% -> 30%
Coment: He can rest in ground while in water tiles, which explains why he's less tired than over unwalkable in which he has to continually fly.

Ironbeak
Some nerfs, he's not as heavy as most 4 MP.
Health 54 -> 50
Mace 17-2 -> 16-2
Blade resistance 40% -> 35%
Cold & Fire resistances 0% -> -5%
Mountain movement cost 3 -> 4
Mountain defense 60% -> 50%

Health 69 -> 66
Impact resistance 20% -> 15%
Pierce resistance 30% -> 25%
Blade resistance 40% -> 35%
Cold resistance 0% -> -5%
Fire resistance 0% -> 0% (the same)
Mountain movement cost 3 -> 4
Mountain defense 60% -> 50%
Swamp defense 50% -> 40%

CULTISTS
They actually lacks of too much ranged, we will give some modifications to make this faction less handicaps from having too poor ranged. In overall
ranged range adjusments. Also a nice new... I WILL WRITE descriptions for those units! as a cult for Cultist!

Cultist
DESCRIPTION: Cultists are a group of men that usually have secret reunions, no-one is sure about their real intentions, but the true is that they're
commonly seen fighting weird creatures and monstrosities in their side, so cultists are both feared and hated.
--> Spanish: Los cultistas son un grupo de hombres que frecuentemente tienen reuniones secretas. Nadie sabe de sus verdaderas intenciones, pero lo
cierto es que se les ve luchando con criaturas y mounstrosidades de su mismo bando razón por lo cual los cultistas son tanto odiados como temidos. 

Covert
Considering it has a way stronger mele than Rogues and that he looks a bit boring to sight, we will add him a very weak ranged atack.
NEW ATACK: Darts 5-1 pierce ranged
DESCRIPTION: Coverts are misterous people, there is not that much information about them apart that people consider them as humanity traitors because
fighting in the side of those unknown monsters and weird mutants.
---> Spanish: Los Encubiertos son gente algo misteriosa, no se conoce mucho de estos individuos aparte de que algunos los consideran como traidores
de la humanidad al estar luchando al lado de estos mounstros desconocidos y mutantes extraños.

Executioner NEW ATACK: Darts 5-3 pierce ranged
DESCRIPTION: They're named Exectutioners just because if you question them why they are doing those genocides they will just ask 'for the common good'
which is strange coming from a genocidal... inquietant... but there is a question...
What does want this people exactly?
And what are their reassons for the genetic manipulation, asesinations and inmoral acts.
---> Spanish: Se les llama verdugos porque sí le pides una explicación a estos hombres del porqué de sus acciones estos solo dirán "por el bien común"
algo que parece bastante extraño viniendo de un genocida... inquietante... pero cabe preguntarse ¿qué es lo que esta gente quiere exactamente? y 
cuales son sus razones para justificar tantos experimientos genéticos, mutilizaciones y actos inmorales.


Spy
Needle 8-2 blade mele -> 9-2 pierce mele (it still poisons)
NEW Atack: Darts 5-2 pierce ranged (bleeding)
DESCRIPTION: Spies are the most mysterous of all cultist, he's probably watching the human society disorders... maybe this mantains he to acomplish
the factions goals... who knows if they're mentally right or not ...
---> Spanish: El espía es el más misterioso de los cultistas, el está observando los desordenes de la sociedad humana.... quizás esto le permita
mantener las metas de su facción... sabrá alguién sí estos sujetos están bien o mal de la cabeza ...

Overt
Health 45 -> 40
NEW ATACK: Throwing daggers 4-2 blade
Description: The diference between overt and covert is that covert are more Introverts and less talkative than overts. They feel more secure for some
reasson.
---> Spanish: La mayor diferencia entre los Encubierto y los Abiertos es que los encubiertos manejan todo con código encubierto y que los Abiertos
hablan con menor remordimiento público sobre sus acciones. Se sienten más seguros por alguna razón.

Cleanner 
Dagger 7-5 -> 6-5
NEW AACK: Throwing daggerrs 6-2 blade
Description: Similar than the case of Executioners, if you question why their actions they refer as themselves as Cleanner... they don't provide a
very developed argument of their actions, making us to think that they probably just like seing the flow in the floor.
---> Spanish: Similar a los verdugos, sí le preguntas a estos sujetos el porqué de sus acciones estos se referirán a sí mismos como limpiadores...
no dan un argumento muy convincente del porqué de sus acciones, dandole de pensar a muchos que estos solo disfrutan ver la sangre derramarse por el
suelo.

Exile
Like costless skrimisher isn't already too good... forest defense is a serious issue... huge damage for skirmisher standards.
Trudgeon 7-3 -> 6-3
Forest defense 70% -> 60%
Swamp defense 70% -> 50%
Description: Exiled are men that used to be in the human society like any good man, but because of diferences in belief or because of a miss-
understanding those men ended bein exiled. After living for some time in the wild those men found a cultist and after a long talking the cultist
persuaded him to fight for their cause. Letting us to think that a good man can easly join to the cause of cultists.
---> Spanish: Los exiliados eran hombres que antes formaban parte de la socidad como todo buen hombre, sin embargo, debido a la diferencia de sus
creencias o a algún malentendido a estos hombres se les ha exiliado de la sociedad. Acostumbrados a vivir en medios silvestres, un día estos hombres
por alguna razón se encontraron con un cultista que los persuadió para unirse a sus causas despues de una larga charla. Dando a entender, que un
buen hombre puede fácilmente unirse a las causas de los cultistas.

Actually a good unit, but for survival purposes we will add him 60% castle defense. But nerfing some miscelanous terrain defenses.
Health 50 -> 48
Castle defense 50% -> 60%
Swamp movement cost 1 -> 2
Swamp defense 70% -> 50%
Fungus defense 70% -> 60%

Price 25g -> 27g
Description: After some time, Banished are started to be haten like cultists are, doesn't cares to the banished, he's completely used to be rejected
by the society but not to the cultists. He probably became arrogant and more immoral than used to be.
Spanish: Despues de cierto tiempo, los desterrados empiezan a ser odiados como los cultistas, cosa que no le importa. Él está completamente 
acostumbrado a ser rechazado por la sociedad pero no por los cultistas. El probablemente se ha vuelto más arrogante y algo más inmoral que antes.

Mace 16-3 -> 15-3
Castle defense 50% -> 60%
Swamp movement cost 1 -> 2

Fungus defense 70% -> 60%
Price 44g -> 46g
Description: It's said that if the society finds this individuals they would have death condemn ... the reasson are variable, but it looks like that
those men were brainwashed, he's irreconosible.
---> Spanish: Se dice que sí la sociedad pilla a uno de estos individuos tienen condena de muerte ... las razones son variadas, pareciera como sí
estos hubieran pasado por una especie de lavado cerebral, está irreconosible.

Lonewolf
Nerfs on the way, this unit has unnusually good properties.
Health 52 -> 42
Claws 7-4 -> 6-4 (preventing 9-4 skirmisher during night...)
AMLA XP 100 -> 85
Price 32g -> 30g
Description: Some exile prefer more to stay in wild rather than going for cultists goals, cultists have no problems with that and they gift him
wolves claws in one of his two hands. They trust that when he is called for figting for the cult he will proceed.
---> Spanish: Algunos exiliados perfieren estar más en lo salvaje que por ir a las metas de los cultistas. Los cultistas no tienen problema alguno
con eso y le dieron garras de lobo en una de las 2 manos. Ellos confian que cuando se le llame para luchar por el culto este participará.

Freak
I've never liked Freaks at all, didn't never liked their stats at all. I will make it more atractive to use.
Fist 9-2 -> 10-2
Fire resistance -20% -> -15%
Cold resistance 0% -> -5%
Mountain defense 50% -> 40%
Village defense 50% -> 40%
Swamp defense 60% -> 40%
Description: Freaks are weird green humanoid creatures with hard skin and that are clumsy. No-one knows their exact origin, but it's sure it's not
human being. It's probably a the result of a wrong experiment that it was left to die.
---> Spanish: Los mounstros son criaturas humanoides extrañas de color verde con una piel dura y que son torpes. Nadie sabe su origen, pero se está
seguro que no son humanos. Es probablemente el producto de una experimentación a la cual se le dejó morir.

Miscreation
Fist 13-2 -> 15-2
Pierce resistance 40% -> 30%
Fire resistance -20% -> -15%
Cold resistance 0% -> -5%
Mountain defense 50% -> 40%
Village defense 50% -> 40%
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Price 22g -> 28g
Description: Miscreation has grown unnaturally fast. Unexpected to live that long... Now it has claws in one of the 2 hands, being not symetrical. 
Looks like it's genetically designed for fighting ... but why it was left to die earlier?
coded for fighting. This give us that cultist have an oddly good knowledge of genetics.
---> Spanish: la Mala creación ha crecido inusualmente rápido. No se le esperaba vivir tanto... ahora tiene garras en una de las 2 manos, siendo
asimétrico. Pareciera que fué geneticamente diseñado para luchar, lo cual destaca que los cultistas tienen un extrañamente buen conocimiento de la
genética.

Mouunstrocity
Fist 15-3 -> 16-3
Blade & Pierce resistance 40% -> 35%
Fire resistance -20% -> -10%
Cold resistance 20% -> 10%
Mountain defense 50% -> 40%
Village defense 50% -> 40%
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Price 47g -> 48g
Description: Mounstrosity is the final result of a creature that fought for its life in an hostile world. Afterall the failed experiment wasn't 
a failure, but wasn't probably what cultists wanted in the begin. Looks like cultists now apreciates this creature. But ... what were trying cultists
to do that ended in such horrible creature? we could say that freaks were the hardest of their experiments and that ended with unwanted results.
---> Spanish: La mounstrosidad es el resultado final de una criatura que ha luchado en un mundo hostil. Despues de todo el experimento fallido no 
fué un fracaso, pero muy probablemente no era lo que los cultistas estaban buscando. Los cultitas al parecer ahora aprecian a esta criatura. Pero...
cabe preguntarse ¿que estaban intentando estos que terminó en esta horrible creatura? podríamos decir que es el experimento más dificil de ellos y
que probablemente ha terminado con resultados indeseados.

Lookout
Extremely good scout unit, but we will make some reconsiderations
Impact resistance 0% -> -5%
Village defense 60% -> 50%
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Description: Apart that those men are more swift than regular humans, there is not that much diference between regular humans. Apart of having a weight of 15 less kilograms than a regular human in average there is not that much diference apart of regular humans.
---> Spanish: Aparte de que estos hombres son más lígeros que los humanos regulares, no hay mucha diferencia. Aparte de tener un peso de 15 kilos
menos que un humano común, no hay mucha más diferencia.

Sentry
Considering some rebalancing.
Health 48 -> 45
Impact resistance 0% -> -5%
Fire Arrow 10-2 -> 8-2
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Village defense (unchanged, mostly for the name)
Price 25g -> 30g
Description: Sentry similar to lookout, are swift. Also for some reasson those men are given the purporse to watch and warn if their camps are
being atacked. Apart of their innusual swiftness, those men look like that need less sleep to acomplish their function.
---> Spanish: parecido a los atentos, son ligeros. Aunque por alguna razón a estos hombres se les ha dado la tarea de vigilar y de avisar sí sus 
campamentos están siendo atacados. Aparte de su ligereza inusual, al parecer estos hombres necesitan dormir menos para cumplir su función.

Beacon
Health 65 -> 60
Torch damage 14-3 -> 13-3
Fire arrow 14-2 -> 12-2
Description: Beacon has now a weight more similar to regular humans, but afterall, he's still as fast. They're completely sane mentally giving us
to know that he got used to live with that lot of monsters, misscreations and cultist doing inmoral experiments. Thes men shine for a solid emotional
and mental health unlike most of their companions. It's said that some beacon leaves the cult for days to live in the society and then coming back
to the cult, but probably with no kind of intention or betray singals.
---> Los faro tienen ahora un peso más similar al de un humano regular, pero ante todo, el sigue siendo así de rápido. Son completamente sanos 
mentalmente a diferencia de sus compañeros incluso al vivir entre tantos mounstros, mal formaciones y cultistas haciendo experimentos inmorales. 
Estos hombres destacan por una solida estabilidad y salud mental. Se dice que estos algunas veces dejan al culto para vivir en la sociedad y luego
volviendo al culto, pero lo más probable es que sin ningún tipo de intención o signos de traición.

Recruit
Spar 3-2 -> 4-2 ranged
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Fungus defense 60% -> 50%
Description: Cultists oftenly recruit mercenaries that fight for anyone's cause for some coins. Those men have no idea in what their live will turn...
---> Spanish: Los cultistas frecuentemente reclutan mercenarios que luchan para cualquiera por algunas monedas, pero estos no tienen idea de que 
les espera en sus vidas...

Rebel
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Fungus defense 60% -> 50%
Price 28g -> 27g
Description: Rebels and Subverters after fighting some time for the cultist they're still figting for the cult, but unlike recruits they opposite 
society and do not fight just for coins. They still have no real idea the meanings of the cult, but they don't seem to be brainwashed, just uninformed.
---> Los rebeldes despues de pelear un tiempo con los cultistas siguen haciendolo, pero a diferencia de los reclutas estos se oponen a la sociedad y
no pelean solo por monedas. Estos aún no tienen idea de las implicaciones del culto, pero no parecen ser víctimas de un lavado cerebral, solo están
desinformados.

Subverter
Spear 8-4 -> 7-4 ranged
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Fungus defense 60% -> 50%
Description: Rebels and Subverters after fighting some time for the cultist they're still figting for the cult, but unlike recruits they opposite 
society and do not fight just for coins. They still have no real idea the meanings of the cult, but they don't seem to be brainwashed, just uninformed.
---> Los rebeldes despues de pelear un tiempo con los cultistas siguen haciendolo, pero a diferencia de los reclutas estos se oponen a la sociedad y
no pelean solo por monedas. Estos aún no tienen idea de las implicaciones del culto, pero no parecen ser víctimas de un lavado cerebral, solo están
desinformados.

Transformation
Some readjustments will be needed.
Fire resistance -20% -> -10%
Swamp defense 70% -> 60%
Fungus defense 70% -> 60%
Price 25g -> 27g
Description: Transformation used to be human ... it's not known what kind of process ocurried to them... but looks like cult is capable to corrupt
the genetic data of already born living. The question is ... what kind of technique they use for those genetic manipulations... creepy... also, it
does still think like an human; also which would be reassons of why those men allowed themselves being the product of such experiments.
---> Spanish: La transformación solía ser humano... no se sabe que clase de proceso ha ocurrido en ellos... pero al parecer el culto es capaz de
corromper el código genético de un ser ya nacido. La pregunta es ... ¿qué clase de técnica utilizan para sus manipulaciones genéticas? aterrador...
sin embargo, esta cosa aún piensa como un humano, pero cuales habrán sido las razones para que estos hombres se permitieran ser produco de estos 
experimentos genéticos.

Mutant
Bite 25-1 -> 23-1 (RPG potential)
Fire resistance -20% -> -10%
Cold resistance 10% -> 0%
Swamp defense 70% -> 60%
Fungus defense 70% -> 60%
XP 124 -> 110
Price 45g -> 47g
Description: Mutant is starting to lose its Human features even at its personality as human. Looks like that it's not just genetic corruption it's
now conscience corruption too. It is just becoming into killing machines ... also, it's said that recruits that acess for the genetics modifications
were men that wanted to forgive their past and that were better informed about the cult itself.
---> Spanish: El mutante está empezando a perder sus razgos humanos y su personalidad como humano. Al parecer la corrupción no es solo genética sino
también de conciencia. Se está volviendo una máquina de matar ... aunque, se dice que los reclutas que se permiten estas modificaciones genéticas eran
hombres que querian olvidar su pasado y que estaban mejor informados sobre el culto en sí.

Inhuman
Pierce resistane 40% -> 30%
Fire resistance -20% -> -10%
Swamp defense (unchanged)
Fungus defense (unchanged)
Price 55g -> 70g
Description: Inhuman has no longer human characteristics. It has an incredible feast for killing (not just humans). Still it's hard to make those
things to talk, also it can still can mantain a conversation, also its vocal chords will difficult it to talk, apart of decrease inteligence than
a regular human, still, if it were persuaded it could tell us a lot about of the cult ... sadly, it's too loyal to them.
---> El Inhumano a no tiene rasgos humanos. Tiene ina increible sadiedd por matar (no solo a humanos). Aunque es díficil hacer que estas cosas hablen
pueden hablar, aunque sus cuerdas vocales le dificultan hablar, aparte de su inteligencia inferior a la de un humano regular, aún así sí fuese 
persuadida podría hablarnos un montón sobre el culto ... lástimosamente es demasiado leal hacia ellos.

Survivor
Due the buff of some ranged units in the faction, survivor has been nerfed a bit.
Health 50 -> 47
Fire resistance 0% -> -5% - /rejected
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Fungus defense 60% -> 50%
Description: The survivor is a real accomplishment to the cultist's genetics. If we look, all cultists are men or asexual, but never female. They 
consider the male gender as the superior gender and for that reasson they do not consider the female gender because of their genetics knowledge.
Descripción: El superviviente es un logro de la manipulación de la genética de los cultistas. Sí nos fijamos bien, todos los cultitas y sus mutantes
o son del género masculino o son asexuales, pero nunca son del género femenino. Consideran el género masculino como el superior y razón por la cual
consideran necesario del género femenino dada a sus avanzados conocimientos de la genética.

Outlaster
Health 74 -> 65
Fist 10-2 -> 11-2
Fire resistance 0% -> -5% - /rejected
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Fungus defense 60% -> 50%
Price 24g -> 30g
Description: Outlaster is a proof man about any extreme climatic situation and capable to live alone in the wild. It's unknown why cultist wanted a
too resistant and long lived creation unlike most of theirs. Meaning that the cult have long time goals...
---> Spanish: El duradero es un hombre a prueba de cualquier situación climática extrema y es capaz de vivir solo en lo salvaje. No se sabe porque
los cultistas querian una creación tan longeva muy diferente de la mayoría de ls creaciones de ellos. Queriendo decir que el culto tiene una meta
de largo plazo...

Remnant
Health 92 -> 85
Inner Strength 32-1 -> 27-1
Fire resistance 0% -> -5% - /rejected
Swamp defense 60% -> 50%
Fungus defense 60% -> 50%
Price 46g -> 53g
Description: After decades of long long living, looks like he's stronger than ever. In his actual age any human would feel weak, ancient or sick,
but Remnant is more healthy than ever. Some remnant tried to have sons with regular women to try to build a genetically superior humanity, but for
their surprise they're not fertile. At this point they start understanding that the cult goals aren't completely good for human race and at a point
they just start fighting for their ownselves.
---> Spanish: Despues de varias decadas de larga vida, parece que él es más fuerte que nunca. En su edad actual cualquier humano se sentiría débil, 
anciano o débil, pero el restante está más sano que nunca. Algunos restantes trataton de tener hijos con mujeres regulares para construir una 
humanidad superior, pero para sus sorpresas ellos no son fértiles. En este punto ellos comprendieron que las metas de el culto no son completamente
buenas para la raza humana y que en cierto punto de sus vidas ellos empiezan a luchar por ellos mismos.

Primordial
Inner Strength 45-1 -> 39-1
Fire resistance is now 0% (like originally)
Description: Primordial is the sucess of eugenecy. Primordial proved to be immortal at being stronger the older he is. His cells instead of deteriorate
over the time, they improve during the pass of the time. It's not known if this process has a limit, but the few silver mages that studied this kind
of men said he has an expected life of at least 900 years but no more than 2000 years because the process consume certain energy from the envoroiment
thing that growns gradually over the time, in a point, the primordial would die because of inanition because there wouldn't be enough food (or better 
said, food with the energy requirements) to mantain this process in the current world, even at the conclution of an hypothetical case in which even
 if he spend his whole life eating he would still die due inanition. If wasn't due this fact he would be completely immortal againist the pass of 
the time... fact that of course, cultist will never know.
---> Spanish: El primordial es el éxito de la eugenecia. Ha demostrado ser inmortal al ser más fuerte mientras más envejece. Sus celulas envez de
deteriorarse con el paso del tiempo, estas mejoran a medida que el tiempo pasa. No se sabe sí ese proceso tiene un límite, pero los pocos magos de
plata que han estudiado esta clase de especimenes determinaron que podría tener un tiempo de vida de al menos de 900 años pero no más de 2000 años ya
que el proceso consume cierta cantidad de energía del ambiente, la cual aumenta gradualmente con el paso del tiempo, en un punto en el cual el moriría
de inanición ya que no habría suficiente comida (o comida con suficiente energía) en el medio para mantener el proceso. Incluso,
concluyendo en un hipotetico caso que aún comiendo todo el día moriría de hambre... Si no fuera por este hecho, el sería completamente inmortal al 
paso del tiempo... hecho del cual los cultistas nunca sabrán.

Waiter
Helping their only Lv1 ranged unit be more cost efficent.

Ambuscade
Blade & Impact resistance -20% -> -15%

Waylayer
Blade & Impact resistance -10% -> 0%
Swamp defense 70% -> 60%
Fungus defense 70% -> 60%
Price 48g -> 54g

Swimmer and Waiter lore will be done for 1.13 version. I have no good idea for those.


EQUESTRIANS
This is a faction of only mounted units, also, it has many overpowered units. On here we will give a consideration to the faction at all being
mounted units (which commonly gives pierce weakness).

FACTION ISSUE: Mostly because all their units are +6 MP or more, most of their leader options moves more than 6 tiles per turn, meaning in considerable
balance issues. This needs considerations like slow trait.

Bronco
Just some standarization.
Kick 10-2 -> 9-2
Impact resistance 0% -> 10%
Pierce resistance -20% -> -15%
Mountains movement cost 99 -> 6

Actually this unit performs a way better than Dwarvish thunderguard. Impact is harder to counter than pierce is, reasson why boulder got nerfed.

EMPERORS GUARD
There are some balance irregularties that we will fix. We're talking about nerfs but not nerf in mass. I'm out of time and I'm sure some other units
deserve more the fair nerf.

Martial Artist
Looks like +10% terrain defense and counter are underrated and being the only impact atacker, let's increase its price
Price 14g -> 16g

Musha
Leap kick nerf considering it has higher terrain defense (takes less damage if missing)
Leap kick 16-1 -> 15-1
Price 28g -> 30g

Blackbelt
Leap kick 22-1 -> 20-1
Price 46g -> 50g

The only problem of this unit is the innusually good ranged atack that the mele line has. We will left everything else unchanged.
Kunai 4-3 -> 3-3

Ninja Warrior
Kunai 5-4 -> 4-4
Price 27g -> 32g

Shinobi

Similar to drake burner, but quicker and with fire breath -1 damage. The unit is fine, we will just increase a little the xp to lv2.
XP 48 -> 52

Tatsu
Considering the lv3 has 8 movement and really nice damage, raising xp to mantain stats unchanged.
XP 76 -> 80

Ryong
Price 48g -> 54g

Kyu
Readjusting some stats.
Wakizashi 7-3 -> 6-3
Price 25g -> 27g

Elite Kyu
Wakizashi 10-3 -> 9-3

Price 45g -> 51g


HOLY ORDER
Recently noticed that some units have balance irregularities... let's fix most of that.

Crusader
Price 25g -> 26g

Cleric
At stats it's being fine, the only issue it's odd low xp.
XP 22 -> 30

Bishop
This level up is actually out of place, we will give him decent stats for a better figthing role and a small boost to team utility.
Holywater 12-1 -> 7-2 (with this we make him more useful in normal games and nerf RPG or Oricia potential)
Arcane resistance 30% -> 40%
NEW SPECIAL: Cures (will now be capable to heal poison, but no more)
XP 75 -> 93 (Plans for Lv3)
Price 35g -> 29g

Archbishop
Considering that the healing option was much more popular than the Archbishop, decided to bring something really SPECIAL for this one.

NEW AURA: Illuminates
Price 48g -> 52g

Priest
Actually kinda overpowered, let's nerf
Health 48 -> 42
Cross 11-2 -> 9-2

Pope
First of all, pope was the support with both healing and illuminates? was making Archbishop being not considered. Removing Illuminates. And some
stats nerfs. By the removal of Illuminates, having him as an healer being chaotic faction will be less akward and will not over-reward that much if
playing an lawful faction.
Touch 10-3 -> 8-3
Blessed Word 6-5 -> 5-5
Arcane resistance 80% -> 60%
NO LONGER HAS ILLUMINATES
Price 48g -> 50g

Underpriced unit. Lv3 terror is something to consider in price.
Price 44g -> 52g

Judgementor
Nerfing it's ranged damage first of all because of being too ABUSABLE in RPG or in Oricia gameplay. And second because it's not being fair.
Judgement 22-1 -> 14-1
Coment: Elvish hero is 6-3 ... with pierce which is easier to counter.

Supreme Judge
Judgement 34-1 -> 22-1
Price 42g -> 44g

Spear 13-2 -> 12-2
Price 30g -> 32g

Eyes of Fate

Would tolerate that 11-3 if it wasn't impact damage which is harder to counter than both pierce or blade. Just standarizations.
Trudgeon 11-3 -> 10-3
Impact resistance 0% -> 10%

Law
Standarization process. We will make him a way better for RPG but not that powerhouse damage.
Trudgeon 13-4 -> 11-4

Fire resistance 0% -> 15%
Impact resistance 0% -> 15%

more atractive than just 'more damage options'.

Student
Lightbeam 8-3 -> 7-3
Fireball 11-2 -> 10-2
Coment: wtf? it was being a mage + dark adept that had better damage than both of each... mmmm...?

Price 50g -> 44g
