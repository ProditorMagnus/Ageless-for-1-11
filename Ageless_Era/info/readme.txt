If you want to add Ageless Era to your campaign, my suggestion is DON'T. This will slow down the launch of Wesnoth by quite a bit if you do it badly. It would be much easier to simply use the content from the original era. These era's usually have a instructions on how to add there content to your own project by simply copying a few lines of code.

If you absolutely MUST use Ageless Era for some odd reason, then please do not try and load the entire units folder.

** I will add example on how to do this properly in the future. **
