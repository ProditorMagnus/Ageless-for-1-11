    description= _ "While in armies of both loyalist and elvish agendas you see mages aplenty, you never think of what happens to the mages who fail mage academy. These mages get thrown onto the streets their life savings spent on the difficult and failed trial of mage academy. With what little they learned they head forth into the world and often find theirselves on the meaner streets of society killing for a living. Much tougher and learning from their own experience, they are a much different breed than the mages who live high on the hog in research facilities."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
