    description= _ "Shifting Swords occur when a mix of quicksilver and mercury are added to the steel of the swords blade during creation. Shifting Swords use their strange flexibility to morph their shape into whatever weapon is most effective at the moment, and as such pose a danger to all their enemies. In addition to this ability, these soulful blades sharpen themselves at every opportunity, often rebounding from crushing blows without a mark."
