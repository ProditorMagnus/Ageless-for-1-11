    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Strife. It's coding and art were done by Jami, AI, Elrias, Lizard, Quietus, Espreon, Neorice and Various others.
 
Although not normally known for their abilities in close combat, with experience they are formidable fighters. Those few veterans that survive long enough in the saurians' internecine tribal wars are reknowned for their fierceness in battle."
