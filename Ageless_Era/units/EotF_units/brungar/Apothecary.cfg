Many Brungar lack the ability to weild magic skillfully and turn their attention towards the various herbs and sea weeds that grow throughout their domain. They study them for both their curative and poisonous properties. While many have the healers touch and instinctively know which herbs to boil and which to chew raw, there are some among the ranks of the Apothecary that simply enjoy seeing their enemies fall from some unknown enemy lurking inside their very bodies. The Apothecarys can be both a life saver and a life sucker."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_HEALS}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_POISON}
