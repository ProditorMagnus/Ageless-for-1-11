These Welkin are elves which have sought out the great power of the wind and they praise Aten with their incredible skill. They are still equipped with the claw and are quite deadly with them, however, their speed and skill with wind is awe inspiring. Unlike the Talon Heros the Tornados do not wear armor because it slows them down. The Tornado's rely on their speed because of their lack of melee power and they are often royal messengers due to their high rank and speed."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
