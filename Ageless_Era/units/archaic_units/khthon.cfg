These ancient enemies of the Primeval Forces are difficult to comprehend. They are best described as spirits that animate the bodies of victims, and slowly cause those victims to undergo transformations. The Primeval Forces have developed an immunity to this, but the more modern inhabitants of the continent (with the exception of the non-living) are vulnerable."
