These units have no combat moves, period. While this makes them seem useless, they are actually nodes in which an extensive matrix of information travels. As such, they are responsible for broadcasting commands, making them roughly equivalent to a unit with Leadership. They are almost always protected by a phalanx of drones and are not easy to target. This unit upgrades to a Steel Cybercore if it can survive one battle, gaining 1 XP."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{STEELHIVE_SPECIAL_NOTES_BROADCAST}
