    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Myths. It's coding and art were done by JW, Velensk, and many others.
 
Vampires have always had a somewhat upper-class manner. This transfers over to their style of fighting too. The vampires without the family or leadership to become lords make themselves useful to a lord that can ensure they always have a fresh supply of blood. Those who do this are known as duelists. Their masters use them as guards and assassins. They wear not armor, but focus on rapid pinpoint fencing which they carry out with inhuman accuracy."+{SPECIAL_NOTES_COUNTER}
