    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Myths. It's coding and art were done by JW, Velensk, and many others.
 
The vampires with family or leadership make themselves lord over whatever land they can hold. They use charm, terror, and ruthlessness to uphold their reign. They will surround themselves with their loyal vampires, whom they keep in check with the promise of continual blood, and subject any lesser creature to be the surfs of their society, and to provide blood or cannon-fodder in an emergency. They do not feed on them directly in most circumstances, because that tends to lead to rebellion, but rather force the surfs to provide animals for their weekly blood."
