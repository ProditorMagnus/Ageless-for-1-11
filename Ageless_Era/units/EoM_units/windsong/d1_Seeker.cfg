The name given to the Seekers comes from their role in the legend of the Windsong's first appearance: they were tasked with searching the world over for a suitable place to build the first Foundation.

This tradition of exploration continues unabated, and the Seekers' great speed and agility are easily put to use in times of war."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
