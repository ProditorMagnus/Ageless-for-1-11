The Great Library, the enormous complex that forms the heart of the Windsong Foundation, is the home of what may the oldest texts still existing in the world, many of which have been copied down by generations of Scribes as their original bindings dissolved into dust. Most of the Windsong are forbidden from entering its hallowed halls, and only the most loyal and skilled Gatekeepers are allowed to join the ranks of the Lorekeepers and become its guards."+{SPECIAL_NOTES_COUNTER}
