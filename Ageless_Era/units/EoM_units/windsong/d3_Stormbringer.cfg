The name Stormbringer was obviously appended to these great warriors for their ability to shatter enemy ranks with furious bolts of lightning, but seems doubly apt when one witnesses the way in which they lead the Windsong into battle. Spinning past their foes like dancers despite their heavy armor, the presence of a Stormbringer on the front lines can turn the most carefully prepared defence into a chaotic rout in seconds."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
