    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. It's coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The dwarves, partial to clockwork, developed a new kind of ranged warfare technology. The triggermen do not use the crossbows or thundersticks of their ancestors, but devices similar to thundersticks but much more complex. None save the dwarves themselves can comprehend the inner-workings of their tubes, but few can hold their ground when confronted with the buzzing cylinders that issue forth from them, in much larger numbers than from their predecessorâ€™s weapons."
