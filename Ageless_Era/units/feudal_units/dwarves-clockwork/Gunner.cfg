    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. It's coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Over time, dwarves equipped with 'guns', as they call them, become sufficiently adept at operating their weapons that they can reload and fire exceedingly quickly. These gunners spray their enemies with their metal insects of death, pushing back whole battalions in a single round of firing."
