    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. It's coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The soldiers of the clockwork dwarves are not remarkable in and of their skill of arms, per se, but in their remarkable ability to use their advanced and complex equipment. Each is equiped with a clockwork blade, a blade that can fold into a dagger, telescope into a two-handed sword, or be curved into any sort of scimitar or similar curved instrument of combat. Needless to say, their foes are bewildered by the dwarves clever usage of their equipment's odd nature."
