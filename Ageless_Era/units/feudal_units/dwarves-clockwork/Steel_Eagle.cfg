    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. It's coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The sight of a Steel Eagle hovering over the field strikes the enemy with fear and wonder. How any device - let alone a mass of metal and gears - can be made to fly remains a mystery to other races. But while their means of flight is unknown, their means of attack are well-known; armed with the 'guns' characteristic of the dwarves, they dart hither and thither, spraying their enemies with metal slugs."
