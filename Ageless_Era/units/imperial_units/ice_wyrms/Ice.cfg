Cold-blooded reptiles from the north, ice wyrms are the youngling form of creatures that can live centuries. Despite their relative youth, they are already twice the size of the common man. Frightening creatures to encounter, they are capable of blasting enemies with their icy breath, or lashing them with their tail. Even worse, their scaly hide offers them natural protection against a warrior's blade. It is fortunate that their natural environment has made them ill-suited to face fire."
