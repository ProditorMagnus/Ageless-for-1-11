Bowknights are usually minor lords in the west of Arendia. Here there are huge tracts of barren land, land that could perhaps with great effort be irrigated, but is really good only for a nomadic lifestyle of raising cattle and horses. The huge swathes of land and isolation of each individual clan causes several clans to go rogue, raiding their neighbors mercilessly. This bandit-like behavior leads to the rogues being treated as no better than outlaws, and it is the bowriders, because they are most used to hunting down bandits, who are placed in charge of enforcing this law."
