    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. It's coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Shooting a bow from horseback is almost guaranteed to be less effective than with two feet planted firmly on the ground, but the Boltrider devotes his energies to reducing the difference as much as is humanly possible. He very nearly succeeds in bridging the gap - indeed, if taking as normal the poor archery of his south-eastern Lavinian neighbors, he succeeds admirably."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MARKSMAN}
