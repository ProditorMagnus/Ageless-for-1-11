In the original Samandiz tribe, the shortsword was not used. The sickle-sword was their traditional weapon. A few members of this tribe prevailed upon their captors to allow them to use this blade in the arena, as long as they first developed proficiency in the short sword. These gladiators became known as the Thraex."
