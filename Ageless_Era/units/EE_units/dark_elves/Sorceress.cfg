The women of the Dark Elves often join the Order of the Clerics at a very young age. These have gained the rank of Sorceress, and have nearly mastered the art of healing, torturing, and healing their captives again and again. Very soon, they will become Clerics, the terribly seductive sadistic torturers."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_HEALS}
