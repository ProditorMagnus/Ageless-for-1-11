    description= _ "This unit is from Extended Era. Its coding and art were done by the Various people who created Extended Era." + _ "Dwarvish Fighters wield mighty battle axes and hammers, which make them feared opponents in close-range combat. They are excellent in mountainous terrain or underground. Their power and endurance more than compensate for their relatively poor mobility."
