    description= _ "Long, long ago, there was a powerful empire, founded by the ruthless but wise Astragartesh of Horajha. Horajha was a small island, far to the south of any lands known to the much more recent kingdom of Wesnoth. Astragartesh and a small band of followers left Horajha in a fleet of canoes, to arrive at the shores of the Thrascic Kingdom. There are no records of what happened, but somehow, Astragartesh gained control of the kingdom. Neighboring kingdoms and tribes were quickly brought under Astragertesh's thumb - valiant warriors were not able to stand up to Astragartesh's forces because of some special edge they possessed. The enemies of Astragartesh called it black magic; their leaders would die mysteriously, and their fighters were subjected to dazzling and ennervating sights. It was not long before Astragartesh had laid claim to the entire southern continent he had made landfall with his canoe so many years before.
As impressive as his conquest had been, the real genius of Astragartesh was his attention to his legacy.  The powers that he had used to achieve his successes were enshrined in something resembling a theocracy - a blending of religious dogma and legal code.  The empire he established was thus not dependent upon individuals, and it lived long after Astragartesh no longer walked the earth.
The Astragartan Empire was almost a force of nature, nothing and no one in the southern hemishpere could even dream of challenging it.  But one day, something from far away, something not even of this world, paid a visit.  This outsider was bent upon destruction, and so the Astragartan Empire rallied its forces to remove the threat.  In the long and confusing war that followed, the Astragartan Empire learned that it was not the only side capable of using 'black magic'.  It was only about three years before the entire Empire had been brought under the thumb of this outsider, this one that was known as 'Destroyer'.  The once proud Astragartan Empire had become the cursed spirit army of this Destroyer, and it was fortunate for all subsequent generations of the world that the Empire forces were successfully banished to the empty 'dark realm' along with the last Emperor and incarnation of the Destroyer:  Seth.
