    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Myths. It's coding and art were done by JW, Velensk, and many others.
 
Stunningly powerful warriors, Harbingers epitomize the warlike path of the Heretic. Their command of the forbidden flame cipher, as well as the bloodthirsty furor they unleash upon their opponents, make them the terror of their allies as much as of their enemies. Yet even the peaceful Windsong realize that such power must be put to use, and they are often selected to lead groups of their fellow Heretics into battle."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_BERSERK}
