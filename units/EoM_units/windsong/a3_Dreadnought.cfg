    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Myths. It's coding and art were done by JW, Velensk, and many others.
 
The records concerning the master Reavers for whom the title of Dreadnought was created tell not only of their heroic deeds in battle, of the courage with which they hurled themselves against hordes of foes, but also of their darker deeds, of cities razed to the ground and armies laid waste before their unstoppable advance. These legends have long since been forgotten by all but the Windsong themselves, but with the revival of their order, it is certain that new ones will soon be written."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_DAUNTLESS}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MARKSMAN}
