Crystals are bound to the will of whoever controls 'The Mandate'. As they are barely present in reality, they can teleport between areas of high cipher activity (friendly towns). Also a consequence of this is their immunity to Drain, Poison and Plague. Crystals are crystalline in nature and so have unusual resistances. Crystals are never destroyed, they are merely 'pushed out' of reality."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_TELEPORT}
