One of the oldest tales that have come down from the wars of the ancients tells of a great battle between the Windsong and their old nemeses, the elves. Each side sent their fastest runner to call for reinforcements, and though the elves felt assured of their agile messenger's victory over his frail human opponent, in the end, the elf fell behind, cursing his weary feet. The Farstrider, on the other hand, ran with the speed and endurance of the wind, and when the Windsong reinforcements arrived two days early, the elves were forced to surrender."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_BACKSTAB}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
