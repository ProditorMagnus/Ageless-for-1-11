    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Myths. It's coding and art were done by JW, Velensk, and many others.
 
Not all bloodborn grow towards their vampire side. Some lean on the human side, and can stand the daylight, and use a bow, which most vampires disdain as a peasant weapon. However they still have the vampires curse of blood thirst on them, giving them a reason to continue to serve their lord. These qualities make them a valuable support for a vampires army."
