You may only see one such vampire every thousand years, but when you do you know war is coming. These vampires have grown so old, and so powerful, that they believe it time to fill the vampire manifest destiny, and subject every other race. With their terrible power, charisma, and the promise of an eternity of free blood, they can gather the support of most vampire lords and lieges. Those who won't join them they destroy ruthlessly."
