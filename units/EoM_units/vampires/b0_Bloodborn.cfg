    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Myths. It's coding and art were done by JW, Velensk, and many others.
 
Vampires do not bear many natural children. Most vampires are spawned by a bite from another vampire. The curses and strengths of vampires are spread as the vampire sucks the blood from his prey, and replaces it with magic. People new to the blood are made weak by it, and have not enough mastery over their mind to resist an order of the one who bit them. Eventualy, they will grow used to it, and learn how to use the strength it provides them, but until then they are much as oversized children."
