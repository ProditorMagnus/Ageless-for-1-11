Stalkers are the smaller of the Warg bretheren and are known for their darker fur. Because of their smaller size these Warg wield a spear in combat instead of their claws. Stalkers use their heightened agility to great use in combat to surround their foes."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}
