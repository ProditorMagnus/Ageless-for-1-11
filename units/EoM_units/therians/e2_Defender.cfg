    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Myths. It's coding and art were done by JW, Velensk, and many others.
 
Therian are peaceful and spiritual by nature, but must protect themselves nonetheless. With little ore at their disposal, the Therian make due with what resources they have, furnishing spears which need only a sharp metal tip. With wood being plentiful, Therian guards have plenty of spears and are not afraid to throw them in battle like a javelin. Each guard carries extra spears on his back for this purpose."
