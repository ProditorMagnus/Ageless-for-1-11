The people of Theria are known for their pursuit of spirituality. The Therian have also learned to greatly respect nature from their neighbors the Warg. Many Therian attune their spirits to animals which they revere. These Therian are capable of harnessing their inner spiritual power to shift into the animal to which they are attuned.

Therian who value grace, swiftness, and majesty attune to the falcon.  Falcon Therian can travel great distances when in their shifted form, though are not the strongest in combat."
