With little ore at their disposal, the Therian make due with what resources they have, furnishing spears which need only a sharp metal tip. With wood being plentiful, Therian guards have plenty of spears and are not afraid to throw them in battle like a javelin. Each guard carries extra spears on his back for this purpose."
