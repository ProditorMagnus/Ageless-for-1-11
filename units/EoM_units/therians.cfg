    description= {AE_EOM_RACE_NOTICE} + _ "The Therians are a spiritual people, who are generally not very aggressive, but believe in self-sufficiency, and self-defense. They pride themselves in their development of many arts, most particularly that of shapeshifting, but also of the spiritual arts, and the magics of their jungle homes. Therians are one of the few human factions strong enough to resist the other races. They are commonly peaceful with the Celestials and share a strange friendship with the warg."
