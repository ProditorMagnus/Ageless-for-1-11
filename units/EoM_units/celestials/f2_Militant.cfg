    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Myths. It's coding and art were done by JW, Velensk, and many others.
 
The celestials have always had a very militant, and totalitarian mindset. They believe that the battle with evil should be fought until it is over. As a result there is no shortage of civilians who are willing to join and fight for the army at a minutes notice. Some of them even practice incase such a chance comes up."
