    description= _ "The free men are so named after the first impression they gave the explorers who found them. After more formal relations were established many started to find the name ironic but it has stuck around anyway and the freemen themselves seem to appreciate it. They are tough people who inhabit the northern deserts. What few cities there are are renown for the remarkable shows of wealth that are commonplace in them. Many of them live in the cities under the guidance of the aristocracy and priests but many more of them live in the desert as nomads and owe little allegiance to anything other than family."
