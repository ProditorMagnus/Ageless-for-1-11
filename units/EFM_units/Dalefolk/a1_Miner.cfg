    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Four Moons. Its coding was done by Velensk and art by L. Shelby.
The dalefolk live in the creases between mountains and have always had a strong industry in their mining. During times of war miners have been rounded up to form a surprisingly effective militia. Hardened by their work and already armed they will bravely defend their people."
