    description= _ "Easily the most peaceful people on the continent are those who live high in the mountains where it is so cold that no other people dain to dwell there. It is said that the cold air addles their minds and gives rise to an unnatural number of hedge mages, mad inventors, and tameless wild men. However the power of their legendary machines and their fine crafts of metal have brought the occasional attempt to raid them and their stout hearted militia have never failed to rally to fight them off. In battle the dalefolk use their strange machines and magics, as well as a bit of wild lore."
