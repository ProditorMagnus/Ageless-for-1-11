    description= _ "The sea states are a fairly large number of mercantile city states. The sea states compete with each other through intricate intrigues, alliances, economic games, and outright war. The cities tend to be run by the economic elite who can afford to fiance the merchants that help make the land prosperous, pay the artists and craftsmen who can make cities beautiful, and, most importantly, hire the hordes of mercenaries that come to the region looking for work. In battle the sea states troops tend to be well equipped and trained but expensive."
