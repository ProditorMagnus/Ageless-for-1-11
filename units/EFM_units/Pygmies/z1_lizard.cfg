    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Four Moons. Its coding was done by Velensk and art by L. Shelby.
It is a truly horrible fate to be dominated by a witch and turned into a lizard. Even if they won't eat you they will carelessly send you off to fight their enemies without the slightest care for the fact that you weigh a few grams. You will not be able to stop yourself from throwing yourself head first at your former friends but at the very least you probably won't have to put up with it for long."
