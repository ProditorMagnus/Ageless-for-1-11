    description= _ "The Natives are a nomadic people who have never developed metal working. They have a very strong sense of spirituality to their culture and have been known to walk with many beasts (most famously the mighty elephant). They give great honor to both the herder and the hunter; both the warrior and the wiseman. Although they tend to grow larger and stronger than the men of most other nations the lack of armor tends to balance things out. They are much more adept at fighting in the hills than in the open."
