    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Four Moons. Its coding was done by Velensk and art by L. Shelby.
Due to how rare and valuable storm children are a tradition of assigning personal guards to them has developed. Men who would have a storm witch for a wife must join said guard and prove themselves in battle. As having a storm witch for a wife is a great honor there are usually many who try out and each a highly motivated fighter. There is a downside to this tradition however and that with such a tempting motivation and difficult competition, most storm guard throw themselves recklessly into battle when chance comes instead of picking off foes with bow before they reach their charge like they're supposed to."
