    description= _ "The imperialist empire is the largest power on the continent. Starting as a mere city state it discovered a new brand of tactics that allowed it to spread outward. Its conquests and power have made it proud and even though its expansion has slowed it continues to spread the idea that its culture is superior. It widely regards itself as doing a favor to the slaves that it captures and promotes the virtues of patriotism. In battle the imperialists are most adept at fighting in the plains. Their discipline and high moral gives their formations a great deal of resilience but the strictness of their training inhibits their aggressive capabilities."
