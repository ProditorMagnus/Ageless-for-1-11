    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Omniscient is charismatic people with a natural talent of leadership. After some training their Ki strikes are now as efficient as untrained men with physical weapons like bows or slings. It's an impressive if we consider that it comes from the omniscient mind generated by nothing else than his own concentration. Omniscient has also a small and the invisible mind shield of Ki that surrounds him that allows him to take a little less damage from magical projectiles."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LEADERSHIP}
