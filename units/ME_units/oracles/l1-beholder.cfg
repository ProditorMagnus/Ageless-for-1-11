    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Through years of studying the summoning art, summoners have been able to concoct hundreds of creatures. Beholders, while physically frail and not combat worthy, were found useful by the headmasters of the Oracles facilities. They were originally used to scout out areas large and isolated enough for schools to be built on. Though when a single unwanted person might stumble upon a university of magic, beholders are sent out to find and eliminate them by staring the life out of them, or strangulating them with their tentacles."
