    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"When a Scholar has devoted most of his life to learning as much as he can, he is eventually entrusted with the job of upkeeping the Library Arcana. Because of all of the knowledge they have taken from the books they have skimmed through, and the fact they are the last hope for any books that are disposed of by those who find them to be corrupting, they are known as wisdom keepers."
