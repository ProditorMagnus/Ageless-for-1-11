    description= _ "Witch Hunters are bowmen who specialize in slaying those who use forbidden forms of magic. They make money by ridding towns of the witches plaguing them, or by helping out the church. When the church hires a witch hunter, they give him a name and a face. He then goes through towns looking for the person, and when he finds them, the witch hunter claims they are a witch and kill them without any fuss. Many witch hunters are corrupted by wealthy priests who simply pay them to slay a random peasant who was unlucky enough to be the slay of the month."
