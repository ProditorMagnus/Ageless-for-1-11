    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Many riders learn to weave and dart through enemies and traffic to get to where they're going faster. These skilled horsemen are called Maneuverers because of their ability to travel further distances just by breeding agile horses instead of durable ones, this does come at the price of losing their steed which in most cases, is their life."
