    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Sailors are keen in the ocean, though not naturally so like mermen they can still hold their own in the water. They do have one advantage over those fish though, thier ability to attack amphibiously. These salty sailors grew up on land, and therefore have a pair of sealegs and the ability to hold their own without their feet in the water."
