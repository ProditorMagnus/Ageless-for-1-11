    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"The life of a mercenary is neither easy or long. Most mercenaries start at the sad end of the stick, coming up from the slums of society and seeing the glory of a successful mercenary in work. Those who follow this path are called rookies. They are weak, many, and quite insignifigant in the eyes of the experts. Though afew do get lucky and scrounge up a high priced kill while following their recruiter."
