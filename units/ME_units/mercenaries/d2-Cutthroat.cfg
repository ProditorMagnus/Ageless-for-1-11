    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Sneaky killers are often thought to be immoral, unhonorable, and evil. Cutthroats seem to prove this correct. Not only do they try to kill their opponent before they even know whats going on. After they take down their prey they injure their corpses in grotesque and demoralizing ways. Often with a slashed throat to match."
