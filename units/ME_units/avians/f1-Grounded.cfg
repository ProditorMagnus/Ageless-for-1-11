    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"While there are few Avians who can't fly, many have their flight taken away through battlescars, such as an arrow through a wing. This is a dishonorable plight for Avians, and therefore these grounded Avians are in the lowest class of Avian society. Although they are abhorred by most Avians, they serve a big purpose in military being as they are some of the only Avians able to wear heavy metal armor."
