    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"After learning the ropes of a crossbow, it tends to seem that crossbows were MADE for Avians. They're small, and fire powerful shots from one hand, and with enough practice Avian archers can easily load 3 large bolts into a crossbow in the time it takes most archers to load two into a regular bow."
