    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Occasionally an imp is strong enough to escape hell and survive on the surface. They still aren't strong enough to kill things by their own hand, so they generally have to survive by stealing from humans. Thier mischievous ways have deemed them scamps among humans, and they tend to gain slight magical qualities from the sin accumulated in human homes, allowing them to throw uncontrollable fireballs."
