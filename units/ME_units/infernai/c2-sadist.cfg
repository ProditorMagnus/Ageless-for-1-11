    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Some fiends dislike absorbing sin, and prefer to actually kill their victim, making the death as painful, slow, and gruesome as possible. To be allowed such a feat they must learn weaponcraft, because souls are absorbed through the bones and claws of infernai. Metal melts against their hot skin, so it must be crafted from bone and strengthened with sin. Very few weapons appease these particularly evil fiends, who tend to wield large axes procured from the bone of an ancestor demon."
