    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"While in most religions infernai are thought to be fallen souls of human, they actually are completely soulless. Infernai are solidified sin, which has taken the form of flesh and blood. Because of the amount of evil within them they are generically loving of pain and suffering, and feed on other peoples misery."
