    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"After training to become a soldier, a hell dwellers charred body becomes even harder and heat resistant. While they are still unable to see through their eyeless faces, they have a special sense in which they can see bodies of sin (or otherwise). The first ones to gain this insight were known to be amazing warriors, and after that battle infernai began christening hell-dwellers with broken horns of their deathmatch opponents by shoving the horns into their backs."
