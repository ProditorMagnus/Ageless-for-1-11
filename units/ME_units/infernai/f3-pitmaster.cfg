    description= _ "After centuries of feeding in the pit, a pitfiend will eventually begin growing horns and spikes out of its arms, shoulder, knees, and chest. These horns are harder than horns grown from the head, but also extremely painful to grow. Even higher level demons tend to be somewhat afraid of these pit masters because of the things they have gone through."
