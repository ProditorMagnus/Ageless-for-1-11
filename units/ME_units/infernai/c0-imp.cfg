    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Imps are the most populous of all infernai. They are small, weak, and fragile. Most Imps have not been alive very long, and will not likely live very long: larger fiends often kill imps for their amusement. Because of their shorter lifespan they have yet to grow readily attuned to heat."
