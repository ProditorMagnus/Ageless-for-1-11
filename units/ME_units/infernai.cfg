    description= _ "As the time of darkness came upon the land, monstrosities never seen by humanity came from the Earth and spread across the lands. Of these atrocities the Infernai were the worst. Though they were the most intelligent of the three bringers of darkness, they were also the fiercest and most bloodthirsty. They did not simply fight to eat, they fought for much more crude reasons: To spread fear, enslave, maim, rend. They fought simply for the fun of it, and did a *damn* good job."

    description= _ "Before the uprise of fanatasizm in the desert, there were many caravans who traveled seeking great wealth. At the same time, some Oracle establishments within the area had experiments with the capturing of souls. Through oracle greed and fanatical trade, fanatic ancestors were given the secret to entrapment of souls in bottles and lamps. Thus the djinn were created, souls of average people were stored in bottles, enslaved for centuries. As time passed and the apocalypse fell across the land enchanters found these bottles hidden in trader caches, and felt pity for the poor souls. In exchange for the souls explaining how to trap a soul in a bottle, or other inanimate object, the enchanters imbued them with magical elemental powers, by placing runes on the lamps, bottles, and so on. Thus the four elemental groups of genie were formed. Djinn of Air, Ifreet of Fire, Genie of Water and Ice, and Dao of Earth."
