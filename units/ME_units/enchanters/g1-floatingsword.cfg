    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Enchanters have learned to use their arcane arts to bewitch swords, giving them a limited will of their own and the ability to hover in the air. These flying blades are highly resistant to conventional weapons, and can make mincemeat out of most soldiers in open terrain."
