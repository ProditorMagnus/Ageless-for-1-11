They create the complicated weapons used by veteran troops, and have access to more resources than their underlings. On the field of battle Forges lead small bands of warriors, protecting their fellows from harm by supplying enchanted shields and swinging their mighty hammers."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_PROTECTION}
