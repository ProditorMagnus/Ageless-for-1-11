    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Reductors are very talented enchanters who are perplexed by the weight of objects. They often tinker with metals to make lightweight hybrid metals through magic and science. Those who are good at said tasks often make lightweight armor that protects them as much as more encumbering light armors"
