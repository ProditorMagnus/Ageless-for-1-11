    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Although blobs and slimes may appear innocuous at first glance, the same cannot be said of their acidic cousins: scholars agree these creatures are hateful through and through, spewing flesh-melting acid in the face of their enemies and absorbing the blackened remains. Their dreaded reputation is compounded by their ability to engage enemies from a distance, matching bolts and slings with arcs of shimmering fluid that men may mistake for water before their skin starts to boil.
 
Special notes: This unit's attack can absorb the bodies of living units and replenish its own health by draining it from others."
