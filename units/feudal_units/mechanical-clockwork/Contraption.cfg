These strange creatures are the primary inhabitants of the cities of the clockwork dwarves; they outnumber the dwarves themselves. Close inspection has revealed startling truths about these strange creatures: they have not flesh and blood but gears and springs. On the field of battle, they are employed by the dwarves as scouts, and their mechanical legs carry them quickly and nimbly across almost any terrain."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}
