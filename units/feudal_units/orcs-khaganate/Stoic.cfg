The Stoic are embodiments of endurance, plain and simple. They are characterized by sheer stubbornness and refusal to go down even under the heaviest of blows. Time and again a foe has struck down a Stoic and thought him dead, only to see the hardy orc lift himself from among the corpses of the dead, raise his shield and reasume his position."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+"Due to their lack of weaponry Stoic may not attack the enemy. When attacked however, they retaliate with heavy strikes with the front of their shields. " #wmllint: ignore
