    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Some of the Steppe Orcs aspiring to power realise that they actually have a certain aptitude for the charge. Abandoning the pursuit of leadership, these Juggernauts fling themselves on the enemy with utterly ferocious recklessness. In one legendary incident, likely made greater with each telling, an entire squad of elves scattered and ran at the sight of a single Juggernaut bearing down on them."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+"When used on the offensive the intimidation of a Juggernauts charging flail attack decreases the damage he takes in retaliation. This only effects enemies of equal or lesser level." #wmllint: ignore
