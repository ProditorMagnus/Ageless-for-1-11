    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Some soldiers are given a special role, quite different from any of their comrades. Shieldbearers carry no real weapon at all. Their unique duty is to protect the wounded, patch up holes in the line and, if all looks to be lost, hold off the enemy long enough to cover their retreating army. It has often been said by the Steppe Orcs that while the Shieldbearers have never secured victory, they have numerous times prevented utter defeat."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+"Due to their lack of weaponry Shieldbearers can not attack the enemy. When defending however, they retaliate with heavy strikes with the front of their shields." #wmllint: ignore
