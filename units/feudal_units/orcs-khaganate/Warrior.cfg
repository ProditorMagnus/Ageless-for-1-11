    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The rank and file Steppe Orc soldier epitomizes the qualities of his clan. Hardened, resiliant and, when necessary, desperately savage. However, while loyal to their clan, they have little restraint and are often hard to control. The inherent strength of their race and a harsh life of continuous conflict take the place of formal training. Not known for their finesse, Steppe Orcs fight with heavy two-handed battle axes."
