    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The elves have always recognised the value of cavalry in battle, but until they came to inhabit Silvia they had little opportunity to use them. When the High Elves did move south, however, they soon started to train horsemen. These chargers are well known for their bravery and skill; like many elves, they wield only spears, but use these simple weapons to great effect."
