Master of both sword and magic, a Sylvanus is a warrior whose heritage reaches back to the days of Vanimaro himself. The sight of one on the battlefield will never fail to terrify his foes; they are much feared for their ability to call down lightning, without warning, from a cloudless sky."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
