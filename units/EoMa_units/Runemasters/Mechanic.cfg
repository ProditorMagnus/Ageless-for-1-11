    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Magic. Its coding and art were done by inferno8." +  _ "These dwarves are recruited for their uncanny knack for engineering. If their robotic creations are at the head of an offense, then the mechanics form the backbone, repairing oil leaks, replacing broken fuel tanks, and keeping the front line running in clockwork fashion. Even if beset by opposition they hold their own, employing their vast arsenal of tools to hold enemies at bay until their better armored brethren come to their rescue."
