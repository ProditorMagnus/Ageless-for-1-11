    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Magic. Its coding and art were done by inferno8." +  _ "These beings are born from a ancient tradition, when dwarves become attached to their creations, and instead of reducing robotic corpses to scrap, they are often rebuilt as stronger, faster and sturdier fighters.

The rust that forms their coat of paint is misleading, for they outstrip their younger cousins in every aspect. The additional heavy armor plating that is affixed upon them serves as a shield of sorts, and such is their inward vigour and strength, that they can turn back damage accrued through the tides of time through careful conservation of energy."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_BERSERK}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_REGENERATES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_STEADFAST}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_CHARGE}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_FIRSTSTRIKE}
