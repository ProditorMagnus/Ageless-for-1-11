Avatars have transformed into breathing tempests. Gaining a more substantial body, avatars are less susceptible the common weaponry of swords and arrows. Air avatars guide themselves with the currents they have created, drifting from place to place, crackling with lightning from within their ethereal innards."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MARKSMAN}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_REGENERATES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_ARCANE}
