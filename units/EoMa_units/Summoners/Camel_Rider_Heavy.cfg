    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Magic. Its coding and art were done by inferno8." +  _ "Camels and riders that survive their first battles together and become versed in their skill are promoted to the next and highest rank, the heavy camel rider. With their new status, heavy camel riders distinguish themselves from the rest of their comrades by adorning their mount and themselves with colorful clothes, amulets, and beads. In times of peace, they train small groups of less experienced riders, while in war they perform the role of vanguard, riding ahead of summoners and their elementals."
