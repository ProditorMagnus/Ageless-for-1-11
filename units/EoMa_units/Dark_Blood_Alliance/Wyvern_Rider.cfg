Its coding and art were done by inferno8." +  _ "Not all of the Wyverns captured by the Dark Blooded are tortured and sent to the frontier; some of them are tamed and used as mounts by some of the more dastardly Saurians. They usually charge into the fray with their Pikes, then goad their mounts to bite their foes; sometimes, the Wyverns swallow them whole."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_CHARGE}
