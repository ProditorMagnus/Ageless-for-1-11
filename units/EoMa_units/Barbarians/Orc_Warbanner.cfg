    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Magic. Its coding and art were done by inferno8." +  _ "Savage and warlike Orcs form the back bone of the Barbarian hordes.

Orc society is ill-suited to large-scale warfare, which leaves their small tribes at prey to the more organized might of the worldâ€™s various armies. However in the last two centuries something has changed. Orcs now fight with Cyclops, Trolls, Rocs and goblins side by side whether it be in brutal hunting packs or full blown armies. The origins of this change are unknown but one thing is sure, when the barbarian hordes come screaming for your blood the Orcs will be leading the charge."
