    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Magic. Its coding and art were done by inferno8." +  _ "A chakram's main drawback as a melee weapon is it's short length. Experienced blade dancers always buy (or take from their enemies' corpses) themselves a sword or two, to solve this issue. Sword dancers still carry chakrams for ranged combat, which they have become more skilled with. They still use physchodelic substances before combat, making their fightning style with swords not that different from when they used chakrams. Their reflexes are far above those of most of their enemies, allowing them to easily dodge most of enemy attacks, while continuing to mercilessly slice their enemies."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_BERSERK}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MARKSMAN}
