    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
It would be said that Wild Elf Trackers are outcasts from Sidhe society, except that there is no Sidhe society to speak of except that found at Mount Stormkeep; there are no other cities, and each wild elf lives on his own or with his family, banding together only when they have a common enemy. The Trackers are only different in that they do not bother to settle down in any one place. They roam the forests of the Sidhe, living off the land and guarding it from invasion - they are often the first to respond to an attacking force. They can cover as much ground in one day as an armored man can cover in two, and use this to their advantage when in battle."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}+"Their primary spear they coat with the sap of a certain shrub, giving it a poisonous tinge, but they would consider it cowardly to do this for their javelins as well."+{SPECIAL_NOTES_POISON}
