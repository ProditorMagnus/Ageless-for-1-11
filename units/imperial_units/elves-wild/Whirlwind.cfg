The speed and furocity of a Wild Elf Whirlwind is unmatched by any other warrior. He throws himself into battle, slashing his sword, up and down, left and right, in a cyclone of destruction, and refuses to pull back until he is physically unable to continue fighting."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_RAGE} #wmllint: ignore
