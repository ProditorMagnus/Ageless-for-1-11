    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The Journeymen are those watchers who chose to study the inscription of runes on artifacts rather than their spontaneous use. They are often the ones to converse with merchants and such and buy food in exchange for gold or weapons, for they are more open than most of the cavernei, though they retain the aura of mystery that surrounds all runic artists."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_RUNELAYING}
