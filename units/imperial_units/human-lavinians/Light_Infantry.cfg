    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Having taken a shine to the gladius they were originally equipped with, the Lavinian Light Infantryman has kept that sword and now wears a light leather shield. Alone among all members of the Lavinian army, he does not wield any ranged weapon, but his relative litheness and quick feet allow him to run back and forth from battle front to battle front. Also, his speed and strong sword make him perfect for taking out archers after the enemy's front lines have been decimated."
