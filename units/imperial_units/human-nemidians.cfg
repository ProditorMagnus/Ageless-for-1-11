    description= _ "This race is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Before the Lavinian Empire began to rise, the Nemidians formed a separate country in the desert lands to the south-east of Lavinia. They excelled in the taming of wild beasts, such as horses, elephants, and hippopotamuses, but they were not great craftsmen. When the Lavinians first reached out southward, the Nemidians saw an opportunity, and allied themselves with the new power, acting as a subservient but independent ally for eight hundred years."
