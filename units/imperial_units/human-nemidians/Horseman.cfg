The land of Nemidia governs itself, but it has a strong alliance with the Lavinian Empire, and often sends warriors to aid in its battles. The country is renowned for its skilled horsemen - so the Lavinians, instead of fielding their own, simply send the cavalry of Nemidia into battle. The horseman's only weapon is his spear, but his skill with it allows him to use it as a projectile, as well as a melee weapon."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_CHARGE}
