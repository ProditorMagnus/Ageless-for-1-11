The strange appearance of the River Horse often leads the enemies of the Nemidians and their Lavinian allies to laugh, believing them to be riding giant pigs. The riders of these beasts have the last laugh, however, as more often than not they teach their opponents that, though their hippos may look like giant pigs, they are not nearly as easy to slaughter."
