    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The swordsmen of eastern Arendia fight on foot, the better to move through the hills and forests that pervade the region - one border of the vast sea of grass that stretches from the western mountains to the eastern coastline. Remembering their ancestry - the first Arendians lived nomadic lives on the plains, and only after they conquered the forestlands did some of them dismount - they fight with only as much armor as a mounted horseman would use, always prepared to swing back into the saddle and fight from horseback once more. The opportunity, sadly, rarely presents itself."
