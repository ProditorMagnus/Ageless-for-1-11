    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
All marauder children are evaluated by the clan lords at the age of only eight winters. All of the ones who seem extremely lithe and agile are selected to become Scouts, the first to enter every battle and the last to leave. Marauder chieftains usually use them almost as one would a mounted warrior."
