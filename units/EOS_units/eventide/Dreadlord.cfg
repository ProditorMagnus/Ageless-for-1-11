Dreadlords harken back to the golden age, bringing back memories of the brutal rule that the nobility of Noct used over their subjects before the disaster. In person they are said to be relentless and terrifying. In combat, this virtue is multiplied severalfold."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_DREAD}
