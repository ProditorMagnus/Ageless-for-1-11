    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Strife. Its coding and art were done by Jami, AI, Elrias, Lizard, Quietus, Espreon, Neorice and Various others.
 
The criminal and the insane are not wasted in Eventide society. Rather than execute or lock up their dangerous individuals, they are used in the military. Given cheap and easy to replace weapons, these Desperados make exceptional scouts."
