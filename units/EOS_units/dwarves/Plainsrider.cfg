    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Strife. Its coding and art were done by Jami, AI, Elrias, Lizard, Quietus, Espreon, Neorice and Various others.

While through mountains, dwarvish runners are matched in speed only by birds, on flat ground, their small stature limits their pace. So when requirements arose for long-range reconnaissance across vast stretches of flatlands, a new tool was needed.

Balanced in a lightweight steel chassis connecting four wheels is a wooden cabin just large enough to house a dwarf. Moving at high speed, it runs of the dwarf's own strength plus another source that the engineers of Triththa are unwilling to disclose even to their brethren. Though it makes for a light vehicle, the size of the machine limits the occupant's weaponry to a small axe and a similar sized, slow-loading but powerful crossbow."
