    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Strife. Its coding and art were done by Jami, AI, Elrias, Lizard, Quietus, Espreon, Neorice and Various others." + _ "Dwarvish Fighters wield mighty battle axes and hammers, which make them feared opponents in close-range combat. They are excellent in mountainous terrain or underground. Their power and endurance more than compensate for their relatively poor mobility."
