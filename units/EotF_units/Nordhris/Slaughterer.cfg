    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.
 
Those scouts who stay behind enemy lines, or are cut off from the main army become slaughterers - one man army. Preying on enemies who venture dep into the woods, they also don't need to run as much as was required by their former occupation so they have lost their ability to run like other Northern scouts. They also become more beast-like due to the environment they have to live in to survive. They rely on surprise attacks and getting the first hit."
