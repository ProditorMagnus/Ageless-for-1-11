Northguards are the elite of the northmen. northguards are the vanguard of the Nordhis army, and are often sent forwards to lead weaker troops in battle because of their combat experience. Since the fatality rate in northguards is lower than that of northmen, some northguards go into the false assumption that their superior armor will keep them safe and that their troops are duty bound to protect them, and fall into a false sense of security. These are normally the first to be killed in combat. All northguards aspire towards the day that they are granted the title of warlord, when they will be given command of a larger portion of the Nordhis army, and admitted into the Nordhis council."
