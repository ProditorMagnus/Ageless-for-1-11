This is the story of Sodd, a swordsman. In the midst of battle with the Nordhris, Sodd somehow managed to break through enemy ranks. He caught sight of the injured enemy commander, unguarded, except for his healer. Sodd rushed forwards to deliver the finishing blow, when, suddenly a snowstorm surrounded him. Sodd could see neither friend nor foe through the thick flurry of flakes, but still pressed forwards towards his target. After what felt like hours, frostbitten Sodd saw a figure in the distance. Rushing towards what he thought was the enemy leader, he slashed at the figure, missed, and was killed by a staff blow to the head. Sodd was unlucky enough to happen across a fully realized Nordhris healer, known as a warlock, healing his troop leader. Not only are warlocks master healers, but they can also conjure up miniature blizzards that can freeze their enemies to death. Warlocks also have some experience using their staves in melee combat, and can wield them surprisingly well."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_UNPOISON}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
