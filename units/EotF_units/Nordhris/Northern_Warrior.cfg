With relentless training and combat having weeded out any who had managed to survive on luck alone, those who still remain alive and in the service of the military are given the rank of Feralheart. Once a Braveheart has reached this rank they are given some land of their own, which distinctively marks their rise in the social hierarchy of the Nordhris - they are now among the low ranking nobility. As such, it is no longer their duty to directly supervise the Bravehearts. They are now responsible for more important tasks such as coordinating strategic efforts with other military leaders on the field and evaluating the performance of their men. This lifestyle does not suit many former Bravehearts, and as a result Feralhearts can often be seen fighting alongside their troops despite their new rank. While some deride this as classic examples of why peasants shouldn't be allowed to join the noble class, a Feralheart's presence does give noticeable benefits on the battlefield in the form of harder fighting and more loyal troops. This causes some generals to covertly encourage Feralhearts to join the battle, and they are rarely disappointed with the results."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LEADERSHIP}
