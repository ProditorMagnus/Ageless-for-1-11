The rank of Wiseman is the highest honor that can be attained, and despite the honor and glory that this title bestows, there are few enough that manage to attain it. The sheer amount of time needed to acquire the necessary skill is hard enough, but the most common reason for not attaining this honor is quite simple: they died before they could be considered for the title. However, those few who do manage to survive will achieve such power and mastery over their art that they can make even a lich's bones rattle with fear."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_ARCANE}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
