    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.
 
After sufficient training, an Arctic Prowler will be allowed to take a test of their hunting and survival skills to determine if they are worthy to be recognized as a master hunter. The test itself is simple and and straightforward: They must go into the wilderness alone and survive for one month. After one month has passed, they must return with at least 40 animal hides taken from animals they have killed with their own weapons. However, there is a catch. If they are unable to survive for a whole month, come back more than a week afterwards, or return without at least 40 hides, they are assigned to their master as an apprentice for the next 10 years and will not be allowed to advance beyond apprenticeship until that time has passed. The repercussions of failure, while harsh, assure that only those who are truly prepared are able to become master hunters. As for those who do pass the test, it is traditional for the family to hold a celebration in his or her honor with an animal caught by the new Ravager. In the mean time, the former Prowler gets to enjoy their new found prestige as well as adjust to their role in society."
