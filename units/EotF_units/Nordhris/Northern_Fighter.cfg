Only the truly lucky or the truly skilled survive even a few battles as a Braveheart, however, those who do are automatically given a position of leadership among their peers. Their responsibilities range from training new recruits in the time in between battles to making sure that the Bravehearts are given adequate (sp?) food and weapons. Despite these responsibilities, the simple fact that they survived this long is enough to inspire their company to fight harder in the hope that they too could survive longer than a couple years."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LEADERSHIP}
