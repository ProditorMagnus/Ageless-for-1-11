Wolfhearts are the few have managed to survive and thrive through decades of service in the most dangerous part of the Nordhris military. As a reward for their unwavering loyalty, devotion, and skill these former peasants are now given command of their own army, as well as a place of honor among even the highest echelons of Nordhris society. Despite their age, these warriors are never content to sit back and let others do all the work for them. They will instead charge into the front lines of battle and proceed to cut down any enemy foolish enough to stand in their path. Their ferocity acts as a beacon of hope for their fellow warriors, all of whom would willingly give their lives to protect their leader, in even the most hopeless of battles."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LEADERSHIP}
