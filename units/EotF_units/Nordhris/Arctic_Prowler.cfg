Prowlers are the hunters-in-training of the Nordhris, as they have yet to master the customary hunting style of those who kill wild game. Their hunting style is rather unusual by the standards of most outsiders: they prefer to attack their prey directly instead of taking it down with a bow from a distance. In order to accomplish this, the Prowlers are in the process of learning how to completely conceal their presence from the animals around them so that they may ambush and kill their prey with ease. Still, many have laughed at this saying that it changes nothing when compared to the ease of hunting with a bow, that is until they stop laughing and realize that they are apparently alone in the middle of an open tundra."
