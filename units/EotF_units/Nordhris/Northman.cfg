    description= _ "In the frozen northern tundra, the going is rough, but the Northman of the Nordhris who have been born and raised on the snowy plains would not have it any other way. Their wolf pelts are used to both warm themselves as well as frighten their prey into thinking them to be a wold of the mystical Gnorfang, who is said to have lead a great pack of wolves that walked upright and nearly conquered the whole northen tundra."
