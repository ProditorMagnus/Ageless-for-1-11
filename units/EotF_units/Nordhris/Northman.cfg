When the leaders of the Nordhis call their people to arms, every able bodied man picks up a weapon. Those that have no great skill in magic, healing or archery, those that have no exceptional stealth and those not brave or foolish enough to throw themselves into the head of the battle, that weapon is the sword. Dubbed by their enemies as northmen, because of the direction from which they tend to attack, these warriors are more at home on the snowy tundra than they are on a grassy plain. The wolf pelts they customarily wear are used for warmth as well as to intimidate their enemies. Stronger than most bravehearts, these soldiers are some of the most resilient recruits in a Nordhis army, but are less eager to fight than their courageous and occasionally foolish counterparts and thus demand more money for their service. Though less skilled than most warriors from other cultures, northmen tend to be more numerous, and use strength in numbers to overwhelm their enemy. Northmen fight with a sword in hand and somewhat proficient with the hunting bow, which is used to hunt down large game during peacetime."
