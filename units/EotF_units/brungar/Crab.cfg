Although most crabs of the Brungar forces are as large as the trolls of ancient times, some council members are simply impatient. Not bothering to wait for the crustacean to reach its full size and combat capability, they deploy crabs at the average size, which is admittedly still quite large by human standards. A crab's exoskeleton can rival steel in strength, and has the added benefit of being much lighter, which makes them extremely effective in melee combat. When faced with a warrior attacking from distance, the crab can launch streams of water. In the wild, these crabs usually survive by ambushing unsuspecting humans on beaches."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_BEACHHOME}
