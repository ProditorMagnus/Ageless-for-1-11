The Neophyte are Welkin that honor Aten. These Welkin take no weapons to battle, save that which was bestowed upon them due to their homage to the sun. These Welkin are, as is common among Welkin, frail and therefore cannot withstand the tumult and the turmoil of the bloody Wesnothian battlefield. Despite their lack of Strength and might, Neophytes surely are a sight to see. With their flaring red hair and red robe, they truly praise Aten as a beacon for the sun!"+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
