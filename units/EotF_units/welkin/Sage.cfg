A Welkin who has decided to follow both Aten and Thoth. Because of his decision, however, a sage is forced to live a life of solitude lest he be subjugated to the insults of the people. But because of the knowledge of recieving these insults before becoming a Sage, most are very strong in their faith and do great works for their king and queen. As a follower of both the sun and the moon, a sage has discovered that through the manipulation of the purging effect of the fire and the soothing effect of the water a healing effect is created."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_CURES}
