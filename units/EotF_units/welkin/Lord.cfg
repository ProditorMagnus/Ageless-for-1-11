The Lords of the Welkin are powerful both in standing with the King and strength on the battlefield. They stand as a shining pillar of might to rally the troops and lead them into the fray. Never cowering away from a fight, Lord's are excellent generals. Although not always a general, in order to have the title you must have accumulated enough wealth and power to be granted this name. Therefore one knows that if they fight a Lord, they fight one who has worked long and hard on attaining their standing."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LEADERSHIP}
