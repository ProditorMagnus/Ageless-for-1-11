Angels have hollow bones and a very fragile body to be light enough to fly. Though they are not holy by nature, Angles are constantly influenced by the magic of the Inquisitors during their youth which results in a higher resistance against arcanary."

<header>text='Appearance'</header>
Aquana descendet from mermen and Rashky. Though this would technically make the Rashy, they see themself as individual race. Depending on the location they live in their appearance can vary greatly.
Near their capital, Atlantis, in the west they have a blue, scaly skin and green hair. Their face has some features of a fish and many even posses gills. Aquanas who live more distant from their capital, Atlantis, often look more human-like.

<header>text='Geography'</header>
Their capital is located on an island in a gulf on the eastern continent. It's enourmous size stretches over the whole island and parts of it even reach into the ocean.
The country spreads from atlantis to the south-east until it hits the desert. Near the main trading routes are many big and rich cities and smaller villages are scattered throughout the land. 

<header>text='Culture'</header>
Aquanas have a large number of merchants, which resulted in a very rich country. In the past they fought many wars against Elyser, Ssrah and Vixens, but since they allied with Elysys
The Aquanas are allied to Trarashy, Elyser and Sabana, and are at war with Vixens, Ssrah and sometimes Marashy."

With their long lifespan Elves are in no need for ressurection spells, some though saw a chance to come to power. When the high council saw the rising numbers of black mages they feared for their power and called for an inquisition. The Elves banished all dark sorceres and the ones who sided with them from their land. The exiles called themselve Darklves and found a new home in inhospitable swamps, caves and dangerous woods. Through generations they adapted to the new lands. Their eyes can see better in the dark and their hair has lost its light-blonde colour and has become shiny white. Most have a darker skin than the pale Elyser and Woodelves."

<header>text='Chevalier'</header>
The Chevalier have a well trained and equipped army, but their country is divided into many smaller principalities, who seem to be in constant struggle over power. Chevalier don't practice magic, but have a better understanding of herbs and potions. They have the most skilled blacksmiths of the human realm, though only few can afford the tough armors.

<header>text='Dardo'</header>
The Dardos are living on the south of the human realm. Their light cavalery is perfect for roaming the wide planes and the great number of infantymen can defend the empire against its enemies.

<header>text='Luz'</header>
Originaly the Luz army was created to defend the Highpriest, the head of the human religion. Over many generations the Highpriests increased their power and are now leader of their own state. The Lucian exclude themself from war, though they posses a small force of elite soldiers in case of an invasion.
Independant from the Highpriest are the Inquisition. They are sworn to protect the religion and the laws given by the Highpriest, but can act on their own accord. The Inquisition controlls facilities all over the human realm and can act as judge and executioner.

<header>text='Regis'</header>
The Regis are united under one king. Under him is the nobility, who rule over the local population. Their army is mostly buid of smallfolk, guided by the better trained aristrocrats. Unlike most other human nations, the Regis accept Magic.

<header>text='Free Folk'</header>
There are many humans scattered throughout the world. They don't have a single leader, but instead are divided into many different tribes. Noteworthy groups are the Outlaws, Mountaintribes and Forestfolks.

    plural_name= _ "race^Rashy"
    description= _ "The Rashy are not a single race. Instead their realm is inhabited by all possible hybrid creatures. The larges number descendet from humans, elves and aquanas, but even dragons are possible ancestors. There is one thing all Rashy have in common: At least one of their ancestors was a Rashky.
Rashkys are ancient creatures, with a magic strong enough to create or destroy worlds. Though they are all gone now and the magic has grown weaker in every generation their descendants, the  Rashy, are still the strongest mages in the world.
Rashys can look very differently, depending on their bloodline. Most look like humans, a bit shorter maybe and with a pale, blueish skin. Because of their elvish ancestors Rashys fight better in forests. While the Rashky genes make them magic resistant, the combination of so many different species have left them weak against physical attacks.

(Note: Rashky and Rashy are very differnt. Rashky have near godlike power and can change their apperance to any form, which explains how they are able to have children with any species. The older Rashy generations still possesed a lot of power and can breed with most creatures. Through many generations almost all humanoid creatures on the western continent have Rashky genes. Newer generations usually don't have much power and can only breed with people of similar ancestry.)

<header>text='Trarashy'</header>
Trarashy aren't very longelively. The Rashky genetics have enabled them to breed with every species, but this has left them susceptible to almost all diseases. Their life expectancy is about 30 years. Trarashy Mages on the other hand are powerful enough to live far longer. Some specimen reached an age above 1000 years.
Their population consists mostly of farmers and only a few are chosen to study magic in the great libraries. Strong and wiser mages, loathe violence, which leaves the Trarashy as a fairly peaceful species. Over time they have build a close friendship with the neighboring countries, Elysys and Aquana.
Trarashy are tolerant to most religions and cultures. Most pray to gods and goddesses of nature or to their ancestors.

<header>text='Marashy'</header>
The Trarashy choose their mages carefully, but even the best eyes can miss a foul apple. Marashys originated from corrupt sorcerers, who choose to use their power to conquer the Trarashys. Though they never fully succeeded, they managed to raise their own country in the north. From time to time they raise an army to raid Trarashy lands, until they are driven back by the combined forces of the Trarashy allies.

<header>text='Dragoon'</header>
There is a small state located in the northern mountains of the west continent, which inhabits a Rashy folk descendet from Dragons. They look like humanoids with a red scaly skin and are stronger than most other Rashys. Dragoons have no allies, but often help Trarashy in times of war.

<header>text='Sabana'</header>
Sabana are an independant Rashy desertfolk. They have a few cities near the ocean, though most of them travel as nomads through the sands. Their only allies are their trading partners, the Aquanas, and their only enemy is the harsh desert itself.
