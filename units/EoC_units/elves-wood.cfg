    description= _ "Many mighty elven warriors of ancient have died in such a way that their desire of fighting for a last time is not fulfilled. Thus, their souls cannot rest in peace forever, and seek to return to this world for getting their thirst quenched with a last glorious confrontation.

However, they usually cannot do so without help of necromancy. Since elves have always been opposed to allowing necromancy and their practitioners amongst their people, their ancestors have not had the opportunity to return to assist their kind, till now."
