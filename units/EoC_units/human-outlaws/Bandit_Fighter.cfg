    description={AE_EOC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"While traveling through the harsh sands of Irdya, there are many things to watch out for. One of them are bandits. Bandits are outcasts from villages who now spend most of their time robbing trade caravans. As jails pretty much don't exist with the people of Irdya, caught bandits are forced to serve in the army. Here they serve as expendable troops and scouts, but don't underestimate their strength."
